firmware,"In electronic systems and computing, firmware is a term often used to denote the fixed, usually rather small, programs and/or data structures that internally control various electronic devices.","<p><p>In general, the difference between software and firmware is the level at which it interacts with the hardware. Firmware interacts at the very low level of the hardware while software interacts at high levels. Firmware generally controls the basic timing, controls and functionality of hardware. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">source</a></p>

<p>Typical example of firmware are the BIOS, coreboot and EFI programs in a motherboard.</p>

memory,"RAM (random access memory), either RAM hardware or software and operating system use of RAM.","<p>Today, random-access memory takes the form of integrated circuits. RAM is normally associated with volatile types of memory (such as DRAM memory modules), where stored information is lost if power is removed, although many efforts have been made to develop non-volatile RAM chips. Other types of non-volatile memory exist that allow random access for read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have limitations on them. These include most types of ROM and a type of flash memory called NOR-Flash.</p>

<p>The name ""Linux"" originates from the Linux kernel, originally written in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. The main supporting system tools and libraries from the GNU Project (announced in 1983 by Richard Stallman) are the basis for the Free Software Foundation's preferred name GNU/Linux.</p>

<p>Linux is used on a broad range of computer hardware, including: microcomputers, mainframes, mobile phones, supercomputers, tablet computers, game consoles, set top boxes, and routers. Linux is packaged as a <em>distribution</em> which typically includes the kernel itself and all the various utilities, libraries and applications intended for that particular distribution. It is of note that in most cases, the underlying source code is both free and open source.</p>

usb,Universal Serial Bus; an interface standard for connecting computers and electronic devices for communication and charging.,"<h3>Usage</h3>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Universal Serial Bus</a> is a specification to establish communication between devices and a host controller (usually personal computers). Though designed for personal computers, it has become commonplace on other devices such as smartphones, PDAs and video game consoles, and is also used as a power cord for charging portable devices.</p>

<h3>Revisions</h3>

<p>Currently, there are three major <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus#Version_history"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">versions</a> of the USB specification, with USB 2.0 now being available on most devices, thus replacing USB 1. It allows a maximum theoretical bandwidth of 480 Mbit/s.</p>

<p>USB 3.0, a specification completed in 2008, can transmit data at up to 5 Gbit/s. USB devices are available with various <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Serial_Bus#Connector_types"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">connectors</a> and cables. USB 3.0 introduces a new connector type that however remains backwards-compatible with older USB devices.</p>

<p>RAID can be implemented in a computer via either a hardware or software controller &ndash; the controller takes care of distributing the write and read commands to the drives in use.</p>

<p>There are several types of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_levels"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RAID configurations</a> (also called ""RAID levels""), depending on the configuration of hard disks. The most well known are:</p>

<ul>
<li>RAID-0 (""stripeset"") distributes the data over all available disks without redundancy.  Improves performance by writing to multiple disks in parallel</li>
<li>RAID-1 (""mirror"") duplicates the data by mirroring every drive, thus creating a  1:1 copy.  Slight performance drop in writes, but parallel reads from the multiple copies can improve read performance.</li>
<li>RAID-3, RAID-4 are no longer relevant</li>
<li>RAID-5 stripes the data and spreads redundancy information on all drives.  Can tolerate failure of 1 device.</li>
<li>RAID-6 stripes the data and spreads two copies of redundant information across the drives.  Can tolerate a 2 device failure.</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>A router is a device that forwards data packets across computer networks. Routers perform the data ""traffic directing"" functions on the Internet. A router is a microprocessor-controlled device that is connected to two or more data lines from different networks. When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the address information in the packet to determine its ultimate destination. Then, using information in its routing table, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey. A data packet is typically passed from router to router through the networks of the Internet until it gets to its destination computer. Routers also perform other tasks such as translating the data transmission protocol of the packet to the appropriate protocol of the next network, and preventing unauthorized access to a network by the use of a firewall.</p>
  
  <p>The most familiar type of routers are home and small office routers that simply pass data, such as web pages and email, between the home computers and the owner's cable or DSL modem, which connects to the Internet (ISP). However more sophisticated routers range from enterprise routers, which connect large business or ISP networks up to the powerful core routers that forward data at high speed along the optical fiber lines of the Internet backbone.</p>

  more control or dimensional input. The mouse's motion typically
  translates into the motion of a cursor on a display, which allows for
  fine control of a graphical user interface.</p>

<p>The registry was created as a central location to store configuration for COM components and all application settings in a standardised form.</p>

<p>Reading from and writing to the registry is much quicker than for a .ini file as it doesn't have to be parsed. It can also store structured data rather than just text as is the case for .ini files.</p>

cpu,"The part of a computer responsible for performing computations, often referred to as a processor.","<blockquote>
  <p>The central processing unit carries out each instruction of the
  program in sequence, to perform the basic arithmetical, logical, and
  input/output operations of the system. This term has been in use in
  the computer industry at least since the early 1960s. The form, design
  and implementation of CPUs have changed dramatically since the
  earliest examples, but their fundamental operation remains much the
  same.</p>
  
  <p>Early CPUs were custom-designed as a part of a larger, sometimes
  one-of-a-kind, computer. However, this costly method of designing
  custom CPUs for a particular application has largely given way to the
  development of mass-produced processors that are made for one or many
  purposes. This standardization trend generally began in the era of
  discrete transistor mainframes and minicomputers and has rapidly
  accelerated with the popularization of the integrated circuit (IC).
  The IC has allowed increasingly complex CPUs to be designed and
  manufactured to tolerances on the order of nanometers. Both the
  miniaturization and standardization of CPUs have increased the
  presence of these digital devices in modern life far beyond the
  limited application of dedicated computing machines. Modern
  microprocessors appear in everything from automobiles to cell phones
  and children's toys.</p>

pci-express,PCI-Express is a high-speed expansion bus which is developed to replace older buses such as PCI and AGP. The most common use of PCI-Express is the GPU installation on motherboards.,"<p><strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PCI-Express</a> (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express)</strong>, formerly known as 3GIO and officially abbreviated as PCIe, is a high-speed expansion bus standard developed to replace older standards such as PCI, PCI-X and AGP.</p>

<p>Even though the name inherits from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_PCI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PCI</a>, PCI-Express is radically different from PCI. Below is a <a href=""http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/Everything-You-Need-to-Know-About-the-PCI-Express/190/1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">list of these differences</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>PCI was a shared, parallel bus connected to a PCI host. This architecture proved to be slow for GPUs in time, and a replacement need was born. On the other hand, PCIe uses dedicated lanes connecting the peripheral to the motherboard chipset with serial lanes without sharing data lanes with other PCIe buses. </li>
<li>PCI and other expansion slots used parallel communications while PCIe uses high-speed serial connection.</li>
<li>The individual lanes can be grouped together to achieve higher-bandwidth connections. The 'x' following the PCIe specifies the number of lanes, e.g. x1, x4, x8, x16.</li>
</ul>

<p>The standards of the PCIe, as has been for other expansions, is determined the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI-SIG"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PCI-SIG</a> (PCI Special Interest Group), which is a group of company containing more than 900 companies. The latest standard is the PCIe 3.0 which is available on the mainstream motherboards. </p>

<p>Mounting a device ensures that the computer recognizes the device file system and can make use of it. If the computer cannot understand the file system format, it will refuse to mount the device. Because file system formats vary according to the type of devices (or sometimes the operating systems in which these devices were formatted), the mount operation is an all-or-nothing guarantee that data will be well understood and reading or writing operations will preserve the file system integrity.</p>

sudo,"The sudo command is a program for some Unix and Unix-Like operating systems, that allows a user to execute programs with the security privileges of another user. Typically those of a superuser or the root user.","<h2>Sudo Command</h2>

<p>The sudo command is a program for some Unix and Unix-like operating systems that allow a user to execute programs with the security privileges of another user. Typically those of a superuser or the root user.</p>

<p>Through a configuration file, usually known as a <em>sudoers</em> file, an administrator of the system can delegate authority to certain users and give them the ability to run the specified commands as a root or as another user. The sudoers configuration file can also be configured to provide a log those commands usage and what their arguments were.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Users typically execute a command to which they want to have elevated privileges by prefixing their command with the sudo command:</p>

<pre><code>allan@company$ sudo vim /etc/group
</code></pre>

<p>If the user <em>allan</em> has been configured on the sudoers file to gain access to the /etc/group file, a password prompt will be shown and once allan introduces his password, vim will launch and allan can edit the /etc/group file with the same privileges of the <em>root</em> user.</p>

<p>If allan isn't a part of the sudoers configuration file, he will instead receive an error indicating he does not have access to /etc/group and cannot perform the command <em>vim /etc/group</em>.</p>

<p>On both cases the system will log the occurrences. A system administrator can later review these logs and audit all uses of the sudo command. </p>

freebsd,FreeBSD is a Unix-like operating system which has grown out of the original BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) of the early days of Unix.,"<h1>What is FreeBSD?</h1>

<p>FreeBSD is a Unix-like (for legal reasons it can't be called UNIX) operating system which has grown out of the original BSD (Berkeley System Development) operating system of the early days of Unix.</p>

<h1>The history of FreeBSD</h1>

<p>BSD was started back in 1977 by the studens and staff of Berkeley University, California, and rapidly took hold as one of the most widely used version of Unix, mainly in use on the east coast of America (the west coast was largely AT&amp;T Unix).</p>

<p>In 1993, when BSD was starting to wind up and stop all development and support, a number of original BSD developers and enthusiastic individuals started work developing a good version of BSD to run on standard PC equipment.</p>

<p>Drawing on previous code from both 4.4BSD (the last version to be released) and 386BSD (an early attempt to get BSD running on PC hardware) they came up with the first version of FreeBSD.</p>

<p>Since then, FreeBSD has gone from strength to strength, and has benefitted from input from such giants as Apple, and SUN.</p>

<h1>Who uses FreeBSD?</h1>

<p>A number of other projects have spun off from FreeBSD, the most notable of which is DragonflyBSD, created by one of the original FreeBSD developers <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Dillon_%28computer_scientist%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Matt Dillon</a>, in an attempt to create a more easily clusterable operating system.</p>

<p>While not as popular as Linux, FreeBSD has a good following amongst server sysadmins, because the lightweight, streamlined code and kernel make for a good stable server platform.  Desktop environments like KDE and Gnome are available for FreeBSD but aren't anywhere as well-rounded as the Linux offerings like Ubuntu etc.</p>

<p>The whole ethos of FreeBSD dates back to the early days of BSD and the filesystem structure reflects that - most of the directory tree is exactly the same as it was 30 years ago.  This makes managing any of the BSD systems a nice easy job, as they are all laid out the same way.</p>

<p>Windows PowerShell is a command line shell and scripting language for Windows that supersedes the CMD.exe shell and batch language.  PowerShell is also an automation engine for Windows that provides functionality similar to Windows Script Host and VBScript.  The PowerShell engine is hostable allowing PowerShell functionality to be accessed from within custom applications including other PowerShell hosts such as PowerShell ISE, <a href=""http://www.powergui.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PowerGUI</a> and <a href=""http://powershellplus.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PowerShellPlus</a>.</p>

<p>PowerShell is built on top of the Microsoft .NET Framework and exposes much of the capabilities of the .NET Framework through the PowerShell scripting language.  And since .NET allows for interop with COM, you can also script COM objects.</p>

<p>PowerShell 2.0 is integrated with Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, and is available for Windows XP SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2 and Windows Vista SP1 and SP2. Powershell 5.0 is currently the standard on Windows 10 and Server 2012 R2.</p>

<p><strong>Example Usage</strong></p>

<pre><code># List all processes using &gt; 100 MB of PagedMemory in descending sort order

<p><strong>Common Gotchas</strong></p>

<p>Executing EXEs via a path with spaces requires quoting the path and the use of the call operator - <code>&amp;</code></p>

<pre><code>C:\PS&gt; &amp; 'C:\Program Files\Windows NT\Accessories\wordpad.exe'
</code></pre>

<p>Calling PowerShell functions does not require parenthesis or comma separated args.  PowerShell functions should be called just like a cmdlet.  The following examples demonstrates the problem caused by this issue e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>C:\PS&gt; function Greet($fname, $lname) {""My name is '$lname', '$fname' '$lname'""}
C:\PS&gt; Greet('James','Bond') # Wrong way to invoke this function!!
My name is '', 'James Bond' ''
</code></pre>

<p>Note that both 'James' and 'Bond' are packaged up as a single argument (an array) that is passed to the first parameter.  The correct invocation is:</p>

<pre><code>C:\PS&gt; Greet James Bond
My name is 'Bond', 'James' 'Bond'
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in PowerShell 2.0, the use of <code>Set-StrictMode -version 2.0</code> will catch this type of problem.</p>

<p><strong>Enabling Scripts</strong></p>

<p>Before you can run custom PowerShell scripts (<code>.ps1</code> files), you need to enable the execution of unsigned scripts. Otherwise, attempting to run a script will produce an error:</p>

<pre><code>.\test.ps1 : File C:\test.ps1 cannot be loaded because running
scripts is disabled on this system. For more information, see

+ ~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess
</code></pre>

<p>You can set the script execution policy with the <code>Set-ExecutionPolicy</code> cmdlet:</p>

<pre><code># Allow scripts to be run by all users. This command requires admin privileges
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

# Allow scripts to be run by the current user. This does not require special privileges

battery-life,Battery life refers to the amount of time that a portable computer such as a laptop can function while powered only by its battery.,"<p>Battery life refers to the amount of time that a laptop or other portable device can remain independent from AC power, powered only by its built-in <a href=""/questions/tagged/battery"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;battery&#39;"" rel=""tag"">battery</a>. It is often one of the main considerations when buying a portable computer.</p>

<p>A laptop's battery life is the result of its power consumption (measured in watts, <code>W</code>) and the battery's energy capacity (measured in watt-hours, <code>Wh</code>, or sometimes milliampere-hours, <code>mAh</code>). The battery's capacity in Wh can be divided by the laptop's power consumption to get a rough estimation of the battery life. It's not always precise or even remotely correct, however, since power consumption can vary greatly depending on what the user is currently doing. For most laptops, typical power consumption during light usage can range from 10 to 20 W, while high-powered workstations and gaming laptops can consume over 100 W.</p>

<p>The capacities of different batteries also vary greatly, usually from 40 to 80 Wh, but high-capacity batteries can be rated for more than 100 Wh. Battery life, therefore, can range from a mere 1-2 hours for a high-powered laptop to more than 10 hours for an ultraportable with a high-capacity battery. Some laptops also have the ability to use more than one battery, bringing battery life close to, and in some cases over, the 24-hour barrier.</p>

<p>Regrettably, laptop batteries do not last forever, and will gradually lose their capacity over time. The rate at which this happens depends on a number of factors, not the least of which is the consistency of charging and discharging the battery, and it will happen even if the battery is not used. For some suggestions on how to prolong your battery's lifetime, see the following questions:</p>

  physical shock, quieter, and have significantly lower access time and
  latency. SSDs use the same interface as hard disk drives, thus easily

  <p>As of 2010, most SSDs use NAND-based flash memory, which retains
  memory even without power. SSDs using volatile random-access memory
  (RAM) also exist for situations which require even faster access, but

Data is read in a random-access manner, meaning individual blocks of data can be stored or retrieved in any order rather than just sequentially. An HDD consists of one or more rigid (""hard"") rapidly rotating discs (platters) with magnetic heads arranged on a moving actuator arm to read and write data to the surfaces.</p>

<p>The HDD is one of the core components that make up a modern PC. The hard disk capacity determines the amount of files and programs that can be stored and the disk speed and type have a great influence on the overall performance of the computer.</p>

  from composing email to editing configuration files.</p>

<p>The most confusing aspect of Vim (and vi) is that it is a <em>modal</em> editor, meaning that it has different modes. In Normal mode, <code>dd</code> would delete a line, but in Insert mode, <code>dd</code> simply inserts dd into the text.</p>

temperature,"Temperature, in hardware, refers to the degree or intensity of heat present in the hardware. Generally, excess heat is damaging to hardware which makes it necessary to monitor the temperature of hardware and take steps to reduce it.
","<p>Electrical devices all produce heat when operating. This heat is created by the electrical resistance of the materials from which the hardware is composed. As more electrical current is passed through a device, the temperature of the device increases. Likewise, if the current is removed the device will (in time) return to approximately the ambient temperature of its surroundings.</p>

<p>Common methods of temperature control on consumer and enterprise hardware include:</p>

<p><strong>Air cooling</strong>: Where drafts of comparatively cool air are continuously blown across, through, or otherwise brought into physical contact with the device being cooled. Heat from the device is transferred to the cooler air and vented outside the device housing.</p>

<p><strong>Water/liquid cooling</strong>: Less common than air cooling, liquid cooling is often found in high-end and enthusiast personal computers (and many super computers, but on a much larger scale.) Liquid cooling is far more effective at temperature reduction than air cooling, but is also more more difficult and expensive to implement. In contrast to air cooling, the liquid used in liquid cooling never comes into direct contact with the device. Heat absorbed by the liquid is radiated to the environment by a special radiator which may or may not be housed within the device chassis.</p>

<p>More exotic cooling techniques include <em>phase change</em> cooling or the use of liquid nitrogen or other chemicals with very low boiling points such as helium. In extreme examples, the device being cooled is immersed entirely within the cooling agent, though this is not recommended unless both the device and the cooling agent were designed for this purpose.</p>

c#,C# is a programming language. Questions about programming are off topic. Please direct these questions to [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).,"<p>C# is a multiparadigm, managed, garbage-collected object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft in conjunction with the .NET platform, but also used with non-Microsoft implementations (most notably, <a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mono</a>).  </p>

<p>Versions 1.0/1.2 and 2.0 of C# were submitted and approved as both <a href=""http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-334.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ECMA</a> and <a href=""http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/c042926_ISO_IEC_23270_2006(E).zip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ISO/IEC</a> standards.  As of December 2010, there are no ECMA or ISO/IEC specifications for C# 3.0 and 4.0, however language specifications are available from Microsoft (<a href=""http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/8/8/388e7205-bc10-4226-b2a8-75351c669b09/CSharp%20Language%20Specification.doc"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3.0</a> and <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=dfbf523c-f98c-4804-afbd-459e846b268e"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">4.0</a> respectively).</p>

<p>The language's type-system was originally static, with only explicit variable declarations allowed. However, the introduction of <code>var</code> (C# 3.0) and <code>dynamic</code> (C# 4.0) allow it to use type-inference for implicit variable typing, and to consume dynamic type-systems, respectively. Delegates (especially with lexical-closure support for anonymous-methods (C# 2.0) and lambda-expressions (C# 3.0)) allow the language to be used for functional programming.</p>

<p>Compilation is usually to the Common Intermediate Language (CIL), which is then JIT-compiled to native code (and cached) during execution in the Common Language Runtime (CLR); however, options like <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/6t9t5wcf.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ngen</a> (.NET) and <a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/AOT"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AOT</a> (Mono) mean this isn't the only option. Additionally, some frameworks (e.g. the Micro Framework) act as CIL interpreters, with no JIT.</p>

<p>Perhaps unusually, generics in C# are provided (in part) by the runtime, unlike (for comparison) C++ templates, or Java's generics (which use type-erasure).</p>

<p>With the combination of Microsoft .NET for Windows (desktop/server), Mono (desktop/server/mobile), Silverlight / Moonlight (browser/mobile), Compact Framework (mobile), and Micro Framework (embedded devices), it is available for a wide range of platforms.</p>

ahci, Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) is a technical standard that specifies the operation of Serial ATA (SATA) host bus adapters ,"<p>Serial ATA, SATA or S-ATA (acronym for Serial AT Attachment) is a technology for transferring data between a computer and mass storage devices such as hard drives and optical drives.</p>

<p>It is the successor of ATA technology (acronym for AT Attachment, introduced in 1984 by IBM in their AT computer. ATA, also known as IDE or Integrated Drive Electronics) which was renamed Parallel ATA (PATA) to distinguish it from SATA.</p>

<p>Unlike IDE hard disks, which transmit data via cable forty or eighty parallel wires, resulting in a huge cable, SATA hard drives transfer data in series. Serial ATA cables are formed by two pairs of wires (one pair to another pair for transmission and reception) using differential transmission, and three ground wires, totaling seven wires, which allows to use smaller diameter cables that do not interfere ventilation of the cabinet.</p>

<p>The main advantages over the parallel ATA interface are: high speed transfer of data, ability to remove or add devices while in operation (hot swapping) and using thinner cables allowing cooling air more efficiently.</p>

<p>Starting with version 14. instead of XBMC 14, <a href=""http://kodi.tv/introducing-kodi-14/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XBMC was renamed to Kodi 14</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>XBMC is an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media
  player and entertainment hub for digital media. XBMC is available for
  Linux, OSX, and Windows. Created in 2003 by a group of like minded
  programmers, XBMC is a non-profit project run and developed by
  volunteers located around the world. More than 50 software developers
  have contributed to XBMC, and 100-plus translators have worked to
  expand its reach, making it available in more than 30 languages.</p>
  
  <p>While XBMC functions very well as a standard media player application
  for your computer, it has been designed to be the perfect companion
  for your HTPC. Supporting an almost endless range of remote controls,
  and combined with its beautiful interface and powerful skinning
  engine, XBMC feels very natural to use from the couch and is the ideal
  solution for your home theater.</p>
  
  <p>Currently XBMC can be used to play almost all popular audio and video
  formats around. It was designed for network playback, so you can
  stream your multimedia from anywhere in the house or directly from the
  internet using practically any protocol available. Use your media
  as-is: XBMC can play CDs and DVDs directly from the disk or image
  file, almost all popular archive formats from your hard drive, and
  even files inside ZIP and RAR archives. It will even scan all of your
  media and automatically create a personalized library complete with
  box covers, descriptions, and fanart. There are playlist and slideshow
  functions, a weather forecast feature and many audio visualizations.
  Once installed, your computer will become a fully functional
  multimedia jukebox.</p>

<p>As of Spring 2011, there are two major development branches of Python: 2.x and 3.x (Python 3000).  Python 3000 was released with many breaking syntactic changes as a result of efforts to promote consistency in the language and to fully integrate Unicode support.  This has led to slow adoption of the new version, as many people are dependent on the extensive libraries available in Python and many libraries have not been upgraded to support Python 3.</p>

virtualization,"Virtualization is the process of using software to emulate an entire computer, in which ""guest"" operating systems can run.","<h3>What is virtualization?</h3>

<p>There are two types of virtualization, ""hardware"" and ""software"" virtualization, with software virtualization mostly being used in desktop and home computing. In the latter, a ""host"" operating system runs a virtualization software, while the ""guest"" operating system runs within the virtualized machine.</p>

<p>Virtualization allows much faster and effective use of programs that will not run on the main Operating System that is run on a physical computer.</p>

<h3>Usage examples</h3>

<p>Typically virtualization is used as an alternative to <a href=""http://superuser.com/questions/tagged/dual-boot"">dual-booting</a> a computer as both the ""host"" operating system and a virtualized ""guest"" operating system can run at the same time.</p>

<p>In this way a user who prefers to use a particular operating system platform can make use of features and programs that may only be available to another platform.  </p>

<p>An example would be a Mac OS user creating a virtualized Windows OS guest in order to run Windows specific programs such as Microsoft Visio that has no direct equivalent on Mac OS.  While the Mac user could dual-boot with Windows, they lose the ability to use Mac programs and access the data on the Mac side until they reboot back into MacOS, virtualization allows the use of both systems and data simultaneously.</p>

filesystems,"A file system is the specification of how files in a computer should be stored, named and organized. This tag should be used for generic file system questions. For specific file system questions (FAT, NTFS, ext4, ...) use the appropriate tag instead.","<h2>File Systems (or filesystems)</h2>

<p>A file system is the specification of how files in a computer should be logically stored, named and organized. File systems present to users a human-readable format of data organization in the computer, where each <em>file</em> is a discreet unit of data.</p>

<p>File systems present only a logical format. They don't necessarily reflect the way the data is physically stored on a computer disk drive, or other storage device. Since the computer actually stores data in bits, data on a storage device lacks any structure; consisting of nothing more than a series of 1s and 0s.</p>

<p>File systems therefore give structure and meaning to that data, by &mdash; at the very minimum &mdash; giving an arbitrary collection of bits a file name and maintaining a record of this file physical location on the storage device.</p>

<h2>Common Elements</h2>

<p>Other than file names, common file systems also describe and maintain directories and file attributes, which serve as a means to further structure data organization and to give files specific purposes, security features or functionality.</p>

<p>File systems usually store this information in table-like format in a specific region of the storage device. Each file is listed on this table with its location, length and other properties clearly declared. An operating system that understands the filesystem format can then read this table to access a file in order to edit, rename, delete, move or alter any of its attributes.</p>

","<blockquote>
  <p>Yahoo! Pipes was a web application from Yahoo! that provided a graphical user interface for building data mashups that aggregate web feeds, web pages, and other services, creating Web-based apps from various sources, and publishing those apps. The application works by enabling users to ""pipe"" information from different sources and then set up rules for how that content should be modified (for example, filtering). A typical example is New York Times through Flickr,<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Pipes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a> a pipe which takes The New York Times RSS feed and adds a photo from Flickr based on the keywords of each item. It was shut down in 2015.</p>

dual-channel,related to Multi-channel memory architecture for computers,"<p>In the fields of digital electronics and computer hardware, multi-channel memory architecture is a technology that increases the transfer speed of data between the DRAM memory and the chipset memory controller by adding more channels of communication between them. Theoretically this multiplies the data rate by exactly the number of channels present. Dual-channel memory employs two channels. The technique goes back as far as the 1960s having been used in IBM System/360 Model 91 and in CDC 6600.</p>

<h2>The Universal Character Set</h2>

<p>Unicode assigns each character an integer code point (from <code>0</code> to <code>0x10FFFF</code>) in the UCS to act as a unique reference. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>U+0041 <strong>A</strong></li>

The interface is primarily used to connect a video source to a display device such as a computer monitor, though it can also be used to transmit audio, USB, and other forms of data.</p>

<p>The VESA specification is royalty-free. VESA designed it to replace VGA, DVI, and LVDS by creating a high performance standard. Backward compatibility to VGA and DVI by using adapter dongles enables consumers to use DisplayPort fitted video sources without replacing existing display devices. Although DisplayPort supports much of the same functionality as HDMI, it is expected to complement the interface, not replace it.</p>

<p>The DisplayPort signal is not compatible with DVI or HDMI. However, dual-mode DisplayPorts (marked with a ++DP logo) are designed to transmit a single-link DVI or HDMI protocol across the interface through the use of an external passive adapter that selects the desired signal and converts the electrical signalling from LVDS to TMDS. VGA and dual-link DVI, on the other hand, require active adapters to convert the protocol and signal to the desired output and do not require dual-mode DisplayPorts. VGA adapters are powered by the DisplayPort connector, while dual-link DVI adapters may rely on an external power source (see compatibility with HDMI, DVI and VGA). </p>

<p>In December 2010 it was announced that several computer vendors and display makers including Intel, AMD, Dell, Lenovo, Samsung, and LG would begin phasing out support for LVDS, VGA, and DVI-I over the next few years, replacing them with developing technologies DisplayPort and HDMI.</p>

It is used to send mail between mail servers, and is also used to send mail from an email client to an outgoing mail server.</p>

<h1>Sending mail between servers</h1>

<p>For this purpose, SMTP is typically operated on TCP port 25. To prevent spoofing an email address, most common servers check the sender against a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sender Policy Framework</a> DNS record, in which the owner of a domain specifies which servers can send mail from that domain. There is generally no other form of authentication used.</p>

<h1>Sending mail to an outgoing server</h1>

<p>SMTP is also used to send mail from a desktop email client such as <a href=""/questions/tagged/outlook"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;outlook&#39;"" rel=""tag"">outlook</a> to the server designated by your email service. For this purpose, the connection is frequently encrypted, and frequently requires authentication in order to prevent email spoofing. Mail transfer can happen over TCP port 25, 465, or 587. Unlike sending between servers, mail does not normally have to come from a certain server; instead, you authenticate using a password.</p>

The key characteristic of a scalable application is that additional load only requires additional resources rather than extensive modification of the application itself.</p>

<p>Although raw performance makes a difference in determining the number of users that an application can support, scalability and performance are two separate entities. In fact, performance efforts can sometimes be opposed to scalability efforts.

<p>A system whose performance improves after adding hardware, proportionally to the capacity added, is said to be a <strong>scalable system</strong>. An algorithm, design, networking protocol, program, or other system is said to <strong>scale</strong>, if it is suitably efficient and practical when applied to large situations (e.g. a large input data set or a large number of participating nodes in the case of a distributed system). If the design fails when the quantity increases, it <strong>does not scale</strong>.
<br>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">/wikipedia/</a></p>

<p><strong>Scalability</strong> is a general quality that holds when the system continues to satisfy its requirements when various usage parameters are increased.</p>

<p>E.g., a file server might be scalable to a high number of users, or to very large files or very high capacity disks. </p>

<p>Scalability <strong>goals</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Performance under load</em><br>
This is a specific type of scalability goal dealing with the performance of the system at times when it is servicing many requests from many users. </li>
<li><em>Large data volume</em><br>
This is a specific type of scalability goal dealing with the ability for the system to handle large data sets. Operations should continue to be correct and efficient as data set size increases.

usenet,Usenet is an Internet-based distributed computer system for discussion and communication,"<p>Established in 1980, Usenet is a system of distributed servers that relay messages (termed ""posts"" or ""articles"", and collectively ""news"") related to categories (termed <a href=""/questions/tagged/newsgroups"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;newsgroups&#39;"" rel=""tag"">newsgroups</a>). Posts are viewed in the same way as threads on forums or BBSs, but posts are stored on the server(s) individually and sequentially.</p>

<p>Usenet servers use a flooding algorithm to pass messages between other servers participating in the same newsgroup. When a server receives a message, it relays it to other participating servers that have not yet received it. Data on Usenet is sent using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NNTP protocol</a>.</p>

<p>Duke University students Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis conceived the idea for Usenet in 1979 and it was established in 1980, developed from the general purpose UUCP dial-up network architecture. It is one the oldest computer network communications systems still in use today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The major set of worldwide newsgroups is contained within nine hierarchies, eight of which are operated under consensual guidelines that govern their administration and naming. The current ""Big Eight"" are:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>comp.*</strong> – computer-related discussions (comp.software, comp.sys.amiga)</li>
  <li><strong>humanities.*</strong> – fine arts, literature, and philosophy (humanities.classics,  -    humanities.design.misc)</li>
  <li><strong>misc.*</strong> – miscellaneous topics (misc.education, misc.forsale, misc.kids)</li>
  <li><strong>news.*</strong> – discussions and announcements about news (meaning Usenet, not current events) (news.groups, news.admin)</li>
  <li><strong>rec.*</strong> – recreation and entertainment (rec.music, rec.arts.movies)</li>
  <li><strong>sci.*</strong> – science related discussions (sci.psychology, sci.research)</li>
  <li><strong>soc.*</strong> – social discussions (soc.college.org, soc.culture.african)</li>

<p>In the 1990s and early 2000s, Internet Service Providers commonly provided Usenet access. Over time, many imposed bandwidth restrictions or download caps, and today most ISPs no longer provide any Usenet quota. Most users obtain access to the Usenet network through a paid subscription.</p>

single-sign-on,Single sign-on (SSO)is a session/user authentication process that permits a user to enter one name and password in order to access multiple applications. The process authenticates the user for all the applications they have been given rights to and eliminates further prompts when they switch applications during a particular session.,"<p>Single sign-on (SSO), is an authentication method that requires a user to only log on once, with a single user ID and password, to multiple applications, systems or Web sites. Prior to single sign-on, a user had to enter both a user ID and password, each usually different, every time they logged on to different applications or systems in the same session. This obviously can be time-consuming, especially in business environments, where time is money yet time is wasted because employees have to keep logging on each time they access a new system from their desktop.</p>

<p>SSO is usually implemented through a separate software authentication module that acts as a gateway to all the applications that require logging on. The module authenticates the user and then does all the heavy lifting -- managing access to the other applications. It acts as a master data store for all the required logon credentials.</p>

<p>An example of an SSO module is Microsoft's Passport, which allows a user to register once and then acts as a gateway to multiple Web sites, each of which normally requires its own logon. There are other commercial SSO modules available, such as Computer Associates' eTrust and there are other modules in Java and PAM for Linux.</p>

journaling,Journaling is how file-systems save metadata so that data can be recovered in the event of corruption.,"<p>Journaling is an area where a file-system logs its actions and other information, so that if it is interrupted (crash, power cut, etc.), the file-system can rebuild itself and finish up any uncompleted actions.</p>

<p>An example scenario on what types of errors journaling can solve is provided by Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, deleting a file on a Unix file system involves two steps:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Removing its directory entry.</li>
  <li>Marking space for the file and its inode as free in the free space map.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>If a crash occurs between steps 1 and 2, there will be an orphaned inode and hence a storage leak. On the other hand, if only step 2 is performed first before the crash, the not-yet-deleted file will be marked free 
  and possibly be overwritten by something else.</p>

ecc,"Error-correcting code, as in a type of memory that can correct single-bit errors. ECC memory is typically found on servers and workstations, where maximum reliability is required.","<p>Information in modern computers is often stored in fixed quantities.
E.g. eight bits may be stores as one byte.</p>

<p>Memory is reasonably stable and it is possible to just store the information as it is. However in rare cases the information becomes corrupted. In order to detect this corruption you need to store additional information.</p>

<p>This can be done by adding an extra bit, the so-called parity bit. This allows you to detect single bit errors. It does not detect double bit errors nor can you reconstruct the information lost. </p>

<p>This is not always good enough. In those cases ECC is used. ECC uses an intelligent method to store 8 bits of information in 10 bits (thus is needs more cells and is more expensive). This allows it to correct  a single bit error or detect up to two bit errors.</p>

<p><BR>
A simplified explanation of how this worked taken from <a href=""http://superuser.com/questions/381875/ecc-registered-vs-ecc-unbuffered"">this post here on SU</a></p>

<p>Imagine a 0 or an 1. If I read either then I just have to hope I read the right thing. If a 0 got flipped to a 1 by some cosmic radiation or by a bad chip then I will never know.</p>

<p>In the past we tried to solve that with parity. Parity was adding a ninth bit per 8 bits stored. We checked how many zeros and how many 1 were in the byte. The ninth was set to make that an even number. (for even parity) If you ever read a byte and the number was wrong, then you knew something was wrong. You do not know which bit was wrong though.</p>

<p>ECC expanded on that. It uses 10 bits and a complex algorithm to discover when a single bit has flipped. It also knows what the original value was. A very simple way to explain how it does that would be this:</p>

<p>Replace all 0s with 000. Replace all 1s with 111.</p>

<p>Now you can read six combinations:</p>

<pre><code>000
001
010
100
101
111
</code></pre>

<p>We are never 100% sure what was originally stored. If we read 000 then that might have been just the 000 which we were expecting, or all three bits might have flipped. The latter is very unlikely. Bits do not randomly flip, though it does happen. Let say that happens one in ten times for some easy calculations (reality is much less). That works out to the following chances of reading the correct value:</p>

<pre><code>000 -&gt; Either 000 (99.9% sure), or a triple flip (1/1000 chance)

001 -&gt; We know something has gone wrong. But it either was 000 and one bit flipped (1:10 chance), or it was 111 and two bits have flipped (a 1:100 chance). So let's treat it as if we read 000 but log the error.

010 -&gt; Same as above.

100 -&gt; Same as above.

011 -&gt; Same as above, but assuming it was a 111

101 -&gt; Same as above, but assuming it was a 111

110 -&gt; Same as above, but assuming it was a 111

111 -&gt; Either 111 (99.9% sure), or a triple flip (1/1000 chance)
111 -&gt; Either 000 (99.9% sure), or a triple flip (1/1000 chance)
</code></pre>

<p>ECCs does similar tricks but does it more efficiently. For 8 bits (one byte) they only use 10 bits to detect and correct.</p>

Created in 1996 by Microsoft to replace the FAT16 used by MS-DOS and with a number of limitations.

<p>The file allocation table (FAT) is a data structure that Windows creates after formatting a physical unit. This table stores information about the location of each file within the physical drive so they can be saved, retrieved, modified or deleted later. They are stored in blocks arranged in different positions of the disk, justifying the need for a table that point to each of these blocks. In summary, for any type of data access to media, you need a file system to take these actions. Without a structure for storing data such as FAT32, no procedure for disk access is possible.</p>

ip,"The IP (internet protocol) is a protocol for transmitting data over packets (""datagrams""). It is the primary protocol of the Internet. ""IP"" may also refer to an IP address, the numerical address assigned to an IP-capable device.","<p>The Internet Protocol (IP) forms the basis of media-independent transmission and routing (a.k.a <em>forwarding</em>) of network packets, it is part of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_Suite"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Internet Protocol Suite</a>.  </p>

<p>In the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OSI model</a>, it resides at Layer 3 (the network layer).  The protocol data unit for this layer is called a <em>packet</em>.  IP packets are identified by source and destination <em>IP addresses</em>.  </p>

<p>IP addresses, in combination with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">subnet masks</a>, provide the basis for the concept of <em>networks</em> (or <em>internetworks</em>, more exactly) in the OSI model.  </p>

<p>This means that a node, using IP addressing, can talk to machines it is directly connected to (on the same subnet), <em>or</em> that is on another network (on a different subnet).  </p>

<p>While subnet masks are not specified in IP packets, they are used by devices that transmit and receive IP packets to determine if the packet is meant for another node that network, or another network.  If the traffic is not meant for this network, it must be forwarded to that network via a router, and vice versa.</p>

<p>This is all in contrast to the common Layer 2 protocol Ethernet, in which nodes can only talk to other nodes reachable on the same network.</p>

<p>IP provides no guarantees on packet delivery.  Responsibility for ensuring this reliability through retransmission and data integrity checking is assumed by a higher layer protocol, usually TCP.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A multi-core processor is a single computing component with two or more independent actual processors (called ""cores""), which are the units that read and execute program instructions.<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1</a> The data in the instruction tells the processor what to do. The instructions are very basic things like reading data from memory or sending data to the user display, but they are processed so rapidly that we experience the results as the smooth operation of a program. Manufacturers typically integrate the cores onto a single integrated circuit die (known as a chip multiprocessor or CMP), or onto multiple dies in a single chip package.</p>
  
  <p>A multi-core processor implements multiprocessing in a single physical package. Designers may couple cores in a multi-core device tightly or loosely. For example, cores may or may not share caches, and they may implement message passing or shared memory inter-core communication methods. Common network topologies to interconnect cores include bus, ring, two-dimensional mesh, and crossbar. Homogeneous multi-core systems include only identical cores, heterogeneous multi-core systems have cores which are not identical. Just as with single-processor systems, cores in multi-core systems may implement architectures such as superscalar, VLIW, vector processing, SIMD, or multithreading.</p>

partitioning,"When you create two or more logical volumes (drives) from one physical hard disk (or other storage device), you're working with partitions.","<p>Hard drives have traditionally had much more storage space than removable media (this is generally still true today).  The earliest PCs had 5 and 10 megabyte hard drives available, this was in contrast to the common 360k 5.25 inch floppy discs at the time.  Because of this, some have found it useful to logically divide portions of a high-capacity storage medium into smaller <i>partitions</i>.  All modern operating systems are capable of presenting each partition as a separate volume or ""drive"" to the user and applications.  </p>

<p>Windows, for example, will give each partition its own drive letter, making it ""logically"" appear as though you have multiple hard drives (the Windows technical term for what the drive letters refer to is a <i>volume</i> - and one volume can live in a partition).  Linux and other UNIX-like systems will give each partition its own block device in <code>/dev</code>, i.e. <code>/dev/sda1</code>, <code>/dev/sda2</code>, etc.</p>

<p>On PC's, partition tables have been traditionally recorded using a small table in LBA (block/sector) 0 (the very beginning) of the device called the <i>Master Boot Record</i>, or MBR <a href=""/questions/tagged/mbr"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;mbr&#39;"" rel=""tag"">mbr</a>.  The MBR has only room for 4 partition entries - so a scheme to allow more partitions was devised that allow any of those entries to be an <i>extended</i> partition, which points to more partitions (the original type is called <i>primary</i>.)</p>

<p>Some operating systems have limitations on which type (and sometimes even size or offset) of partition they can boot from - most DOS versions, for example, can only boot from a primary partition within the first 2G of the disk.  Modern operating systems such as newer Windows or Linux versions aren't too picky.</p>

<p>One limitation of the MBR is that it can't point to a space on the disk greater than 2TB.  Because of this, a new method of recording partitions was developed called the <i>GUID Partition Table</i> <a href=""/questions/tagged/gpt"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;gpt&#39;"" rel=""tag"">gpt</a>.  It works a bit differently than MBR and there is no ""primary""/""extended"" scheme.  GPT supports 128 partitions.  (GPT is part of Intel's UEFI <a href=""/questions/tagged/uefi"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;uefi&#39;"" rel=""tag"">uefi</a> spec, a BIOS replacement.)</p>

<p>Older (pre-Intel) Macintosh computers used a scheme called the Apple Partition Map.</p>

reset,"Use for questions about returning settings to their default or original values.  Other tags are more appropriate for changes on a larger scale, such as [reinstall], [restore], [system-restore], or [system-recovery], unless that's the mechanism required to restore settings.","<p>In general, ""reset"" refers to returning something to its default or original state.  For purposes of this site, it refers to settings.  Changes on a larger scale, such as reinstalling software or restoring from a backup (unless that's the mechanism required to restore settings), or returning the system to a different software complement are covered by other tags.  </p>

<p>There are three aspects.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Settings</strong></p>

<p>There are typically settings that software references to control its operation.  If these are changed, a reset returns these to predefined values.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>State</strong></p>

<p>Some settings may be read only when the software is loaded, so changing the settings won't immediately change how the software functions.  In this case, the software needs to be restarted for the change in settings to take effect.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Basis</strong></p>

<p>Some software comes originally with ""factory settings"" but provides for customization.  From either starting point, the settings might be temporarily changed to apply to that session, or the loaded values might become corrupted.  There are two ""levels"" of reset:</p>

<p><strong>Soft reset</strong> generally involves just restarting the software to clear temporary changes or corruption and reload the default settings.</p>

<p><strong>Hard or factory reset</strong> involves changing the default settings back to their original (factory) values.  How this is accomplished varies.  There might be a protected reset switch or special combination of buttons, or it might require reinstalling software or re-flashing firmware.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The term ""software"" is used here in the very generic sense.  It could be a program, operating system, firmware, or in some cases, even electronic logic or electro-mechanical components that have stored voltages or entered a state that causes improper operation.</p>

unison,"Unison is a bidirectional, conflict detecting file-synchronization tool for OSX, Unix, and Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other.","<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Unison is a file-synchronization tool for OSX, Unix, and Windows. It allows two replicas of a collection of files and directories to be stored on different hosts (or different disks on the same host), modified separately, and then brought up to date by propagating the changes in each replica to the other.</p>

<p>Unison shares a number of features with tools such as configuration management packages (<a href=""http://www.cyclic.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CVS</a>, <a href=""http://prcs.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PRCS</a>, <a href=""http://subversion.tigris.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Subversion</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitKeeper"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BitKeeper</a>, etc.), distributed filesystems (<a href=""http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Coda</a>, etc.), uni-directional mirroring utilities (<a href=""https://rsync.samba.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rsync</a>, etc.), and other synchronizers (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellisync"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Intellisync</a>, <a href=""http://www.merl.com/publications/TR99-14"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Reconcile</a>, etc). However, there are several points where it differs:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Unison runs on both Windows and many flavors of Unix (Solaris, Linux, OS X, etc.) systems. Moreover, Unison works across platforms, allowing you to synchronize a Windows laptop with a Unix server, for example.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike simple mirroring or backup utilities, Unison can deal with updates to both replicas of a distributed directory structure. Updates that do not conflict are propagated automatically. Conflicting updates are detected and displayed.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike a distributed filesystem, Unison is a user-level program: there is no need to modify the kernel or to have superuser privileges on either host.</p></li>
<li><p>Unison works between any pair of machines connected to the internet, communicating over either a direct socket link or tunneling over an encrypted ssh connection. It is careful with network bandwidth, and runs well over slow links such as PPP connections. Transfers of small updates to large files are optimized using a compression protocol similar to rsync.</p></li>
<li><p>Unison is resilient to failure. It is careful to leave the replicas and its own private structures in a sensible state at all times, even in case of abnormal termination or communication failures.</p></li>
<li><p>Unison has a clear and precise specification.</p></li>
<li><p>Unison is free; full source code is available under the GNU Public License.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>The first time Unison is run, it will take some time to fully synchronize the specified directories. It will create archive files in the <code>.unison</code> directory (<code>$HOME/.unison</code> in Unix, <code>$USERPROFILE\.unison</code> in Windows) to store the structure of the sync directories and make future syncs much quicker.</p>

<p>Unison can be run in a very basic way by evoking it as <code>unison [options] root1 root2</code> where <code>root1</code> and <code>root2</code> are the directories to be synced. To more easily run Unison with many options and to more easily evoke Unison from within a script or as a cron job, it is convenient to create a profile to specify the roots of synchronization and other options. If we have a profile <code>profile.prf</code> (stored in the <code>.unison</code> directory), we can use this profile by running <code>unison profile</code>. A simple profile will look something like this:</p>

<pre><code># profile.prf
root = /home/user
root = ssh://user@198.51.100.42//home/user
path = Documents
path = Files
</code></pre>

<p>This will synchronize the local directories <code>/home/user/Documents</code> and <code>/home/user/Files</code> with the corresponding remote directories on <code>198.51.100.42</code> over ssh.</p>

<p>A more interesting Unison profile that could be used for automating backups to a remote server could look something like this:</p>

<pre><code># profile.prf
root = /home/user
root = ssh://user@198.51.100.42//home/user
sshargs = -C -i /path/to/ssh_key

path = Documents
ignore = Path Documents/secrets
ignore = Name *.tmp
ignore = Name {.*,*}.sw[ponx]

auto = true
batch = true
confirmbigdeletes = false

backuplocation = central
backupdir = /home/user/Unison-Backups
maxbackups = 7
backup = Name {.*,*}
backupprefix = .$VERSION
</code></pre>

<p>This profile will sync all of <code>/home/user/Documents</code> to the remote server except for the <code>/home/user/Documents/secrets</code> subdirectory, all files with a <code>.tmp</code> extension, and any swap files that vim likes to create. It will also automatically sync files without asking for confirmation (<code>auto = true</code>) and will store backups of files that are overwritten when they are synced in <code>/home/user/Unison-Backups</code>.</p>

<p>Hebrew, in its modern and ancient forms, is a language of the Semitic branch of the Afro-Asiatic languages. Modern Hebrew is an official language of Israel. Ancient Hebrew is an Iron Age ancestor of the modern language in which much of the scriptures of Jews and Christians are written in. Hebrew is also a 22 letter consonant-only alphabet used for the Hebrew and other languages.</p>

<p>The Hebrew language is written right to left (RTL), much like Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, and Yiddish, requiring special handling when mixing Roman numerals and Latin characters in order to maintain correct flow. Hebrew also supports accents (Te'amim) and points (Nikkud) that may be displayed differently based on the preceding letters.</p>

<p>In UTF-8, Hebrew characters begin at U+0591 and end at U+05F4 (including punctuation and Yiddish). </p>

<p>In ASCII, Hebrew can use several codepages, with the most common being cp1255 (windows-1255), followed by cp8859-8 and, less commonly, cp862.</p>

chmod,chmod (short for change mode) is a Linux / Unix command used to change permissions of files and directories.,"<p>chmod accepts either human readable notation of the octal bitwise mask. The bitwise mask often has the three digits, specifying (from left to right) permissions for the world, group and the owner of the file. The bits (left to right) are read, write, and execute. For instance,</p>

<pre><code>chmod 740 x.sh
</code></pre>

<p>makes x.sh viewable, editable and executable for the current owner. The group can view but not change or execute, and the world has no access. This can be verified with <code>ls -l x.sh</code>:</p>

<pre><code>-rw-r--r-- 1 me 11 2013-01-25 09:53 x.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Permission flags can also be specified as letters (r - read, w - write, x - execute), using + or - sign to turn them on or off, for all users. For instance</p>

<pre><code>chmod +r-x x.sh
</code></pre>

<p>with make x.sh readable for possible users but no longer executable, even for the owner. The write permission that has not been mentioned in the command, will not be revoked form the owner:</p>

<pre><code>-rw-r--r-- 1 me 11 2013-01-25 09:53 x.sh
</code></pre>

<p>Chmod also accepts the <a href=""http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/6905/what-is-the-first-chmod-octal-digit-in-a-four-digit-value-for"">forth (actually first) digit</a> that sets (left to right) <code>setUID</code>, <code>setGUI</code> and <code>sticky</code> flags. If not specified, it is assumed 0 (no such flags).</p>

<p>If chmod parameter is less than 3 digits, the first owner and then group permissions are assumed zero. The following example sets (probably in an unexpected way) full permissions for the world and no permissions for the user or group:</p>

<pre><code>chmod 7 x.sh
cat x.sh
cat: x.sh: Permission denied
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Arch Linux is an independently-developed i686/x86-64 community
  distribution, based on a rolling-release model and targeted at
  competent GNU/Linux users which offers large binary repositories and
  full-featured package management as well as a ports-like packaging
  system. Development focuses on a balance of minimalism, elegance, code
  correctness and modernity. Version 0.1 (Homer) was released March 11,
  2002. </p>
  
  <p>Arch is lightweight, flexible, simple and aims to be very UNIX-like.
  Its design philosophy and implementation make it easy to extend and
  mold into whatever kind of system you're building- from a minimalist
  console machine to the most grandiose and feature rich desktop
  environments available. Rather than tearing out unneeded and unwanted
  packages, Arch offers the power user the ability to build up from a
  minimal foundation without any defaults chosen for them. It is the
  user who decides what Arch Linux will be.</p>

<p>There is no graphical user interface contained in the official release, but several external ones are available (e.g. wgnuplot, xgfe, PlotDrop,...). Additionally there are interfaces available for multiple programming languages such as C, C++, Python, Fortran and Perl (see more information in links below). There are several software suites that use Gnuplot as plotting device. Amongst them are GNU Octave, Maxima and gretl. Mostly however, Gnuplot is used via scripts which automate the task of generating graphics. The output can be in various, either vector or raster, formats.</p>

<p>Gnuplot is a powerful tool as it allows the customization of nearly every parameter of the plot. Additionally, LaTeX is supported, which means that labels can use LaTeX typesetting and that the plot can be saved as LaTeX file.</p>

ldap,LDAP is Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. ,"<p>The <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</a> is an application protocol for reading and editing directories that follow the <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4512"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Directory Information Model</a> over an IP network using unsecured TCP/IP, TLS or SSL. LDAP is a binary protocol described in terms of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ASN.1</a> and transmitted using ASN.1 Basic Encoding Rules (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Encoding_Rules"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BER</a>).</p>

<p>A directory is a hierarchical collection of records known as a Directory Information Base, or when visualized, as a Directory Information Tree. The directory model should be visualized as an upside-down tree, much like a UNIX file-system. The root of the Directory Information Tree is known as the <code>prefix</code> or <code>namingContext</code>. The namingContext, supported versions of the protocol, supported features and supported controls (operation semantics modifiers) and other information can be discovered by querying the <a href=""http://ff1959.wordpress.com/2011/04/11/the-root-dse-is-that-entry-with-zero-rdns-and-contains-information-about-the-directory-server/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">root DSE</a>, though the information might be protected by access controls.</p>

<p>Clients (Directory User Agents) issue requests to the directory server (Directory System Agent) and the directory server returns an appropriate response, which could be success (which might include requested entries from the Directory Information Tree in the case of a search), or an indication of success or failure of a search, add, modify, delete, moddn (rename) or extended operation. Controls might be used to alter the semantics of a request, for example, a <code>sort control</code> might be included with a search request to sort the returned entries (known as a server-side sort). Without the inclusion of the sort control in the search request, entries returned from search operations are not ordered, and must not be ordered. Clients must not expect that entries are ordered in any way. </p>

<p>Modern directory servers support a high-speed replication mechanism which is not defined by the standard, though there have been some attempts at defining a replication standard. Therefore, replication and the protocol used for replication is vendor-specific. If data must be synchronized between directory servers from different vendors, a synchronization device must be used.</p>

<p>Most modern programming languages have an LDAP SDK, including Java, PHP, Perl, C/C++, and others. Directory Server software usually comes equipped with a set of command line tools such as <code>ldapsearch</code>, <code>ldapmodify</code>, and others.</p>

<p>Directory Information Trees accessed by the LDAP protocol are used in authentication and authorization applications, configuration storage, profile storage, public-key infrastructure and other applications requiring:</p>

<ul>
<li>speed of access</li>
<li>a small, light-weight protocol</li>
<li>A simple programming model</li>
<li>easily configured replication, redundancy, and failover</li>
</ul>

<p>Questions that are specific to Active Directory should not be tagged with the LDAP tag unless the question is specifically related to the protocol or the Directory Information Model. Active Directory provides an LDAP interface, but that interface does not fully implement the LDAP standard, and deviates from it in important ways. Therefore, there are questions that can be answered specific to Active Directory that are not applicable to standards-compliant LDAP servers and <em>vice versa</em>. Correctly tagging a questions will result in a higher probability of an accurate, timely response.</p>

using TCP or UDP protocol, IPv4 or IPv6, functioning as a client or a server. 
It is designed to be a reliable “back-end” tool that can be easily driven by other programs and scripts, but is also well suited to interactive (command-line) usage. 
It is so versatile that it is called the “TCP/IP Swiss Army Knife”.</p>

<p>Netcat can be used as a test tool, to exercise network components (e.g., products),
but it can also be a building block in a simple prototype system. 
It is conceptually a network-enabled version of the Unix <code>cat</code> program, reading data from one place and writing somewhere else.  Like <code>cat</code>, it can handle textual or binary data. 
Initially developed for Unix, Netcat is now also available for Windows. 
The Unix versions can operate on Unix domain sockets as well as network sockets.

<p>Autocomplete is a <strong>composition of the words ""automatic"" and ""complete""</strong>.

The goal of autocomplete is to save time writing.</p>

<p>Typical <strong>applications</strong> are in word processors such as Microsoft Word (based on a list of words), in browsers where the predictions are based on the browsing history or in email clients where already used email addresses are proposed.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> When you are in a browser's address bar and you start typing go (for Google), you will like receive google.com as a proposal to complete your input.</p>

<p>The calculations are based either on past input or on a pool of likely inputs such as frequently used words or URLs. The more often a string is used, the more likely it will be proposed to autocomplete autocomplete. A string can consist of one word or of several words.</p>

(It does depend on a number of DLLs provided by Microsoft, as components of the operating system; most notable among these is MSVCRT.DLL, the Microsoft C runtime library. Additionally, threaded applications must ship with a freely distributable thread support DLL, provided as part of MinGW itself).</p>

<p>MinGW compilers provide access to the functionality of the Microsoft C runtime and some language-specific runtimes. MinGW, being minimalist, does not, and never will, attempt to provide a POSIX runtime environment for POSIX application deployment on MS-Windows. If you want POSIX application deployment on this platform, please consider Cygwin instead.</p>

<p>Primarily intended for use by developers working on the native MS-Windows platform, but also available for cross-hosted use (see note below -- you may need to follow the ""read more"" link to see it), MinGW includes:</p>

<p>A port of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), including C, C++, ADA and Fortran compilers and
GNU Binutils for Windows (assembler, linker, archive manager).</p>

<p>A graphical and a command-line installer for MinGW and MSYS deployment on MS-Windows, MSYS, a contraction of ""Minimal SYStem"", is a Bourne Shell command line interpreter system. Offered as an alternative to Microsoft's cmd.exe, this provides a general purpose command-line environment, which is particularly suited to use with MinGW, for porting of many open source applications to the MS-Windows platform; a light-weight fork of Cygwin-1.3, it includes a small selection of Unix tools, chosen to facilitate that objective, and using it is a necessary prerequisite for building <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinGW#Components_of_MinGW"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mingwPORTs</a>.</p>

Users who wish to build any application from a mingwPORT must first install both MinGW and MSYS.</p>

<p>RAID-0 ""Stripe"" is the level of RAID technique used to improve read and write performance compared to using a single drive. In this configuration the data is subdivided into segments and these segments are written to alternate drives.  </p>

<p>As an example Drive 1 will get the first block of data, Drive 2 will get the second block of data.  If there are only two drives in the array the next block of data will get written to the first drive and so on.  This means that the read and write performance of the array is typically somewhere near the combined total throughput of both drives but there is a higher risk of catastrophic data loss due to the fact that data is now spread across two disks.  As such if one disk fails then the other disk contains only half the required data and recovery is impossible.</p>

<p>This is in contrast with RAID-1 ""Mirror"" arrays where, due to the data being copied to two drives instead of one, the reliability is increased due to both drives being identical (if one drive fails you still have your data) but there is no  performance increase.</p>

It was one of the first Live CDs available, and is known as the ""original"" Debian-based Live CD.</p>

<p>It is a RAM-resident distro, meaning it is designed to load everything into RAM at start-up, run its full functionality in the Live session, and have the capability for changes to persist beyond the session.  Text mode requires only 32 MB of RAM.  At least 128 MB is needed for graphics mode with LXDE (at least 512 MB of RAM is recommended to use the various office products).</p>

<p>The Knoppix Live System starts and runs about 5 times faster from a USB flash drive than from a CD or DVD.  It can also be installed on a hard drive (although it will still run from RAM, the hard drive speeds startup and provides more storage capacity). </p>

<p>Although it is ""lightweight"" to operate from RAM, the KDE desktop is available as an option, as well as the typical ""full sized"" applications (although these may be optimized to reduce RAM requirements).</p>

<p>There are over three dozen distros descended from Knoppix, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Damn Small Linux (based on Knoppix)</li>
<li>Kali Linux (originally based on an offshoot of Knoppix, but now based directly on Debian Testing)</li>

<h3>New to C++?</h3>

<p>Welcome! Whether you are new to programming or are coming to C++ from another programming language, it is highly recommended to have a <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/"">good book</a> from which to learn the language.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a good compiler, <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">g++</a> is the most commonly used compiler on Linux and other platforms, while <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualc/ee340952.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft Visual C++</a> is the most commonly used compiler on Windows.

<h3>C++0x</h3>

<p>The language standard has remained pretty much the same for a long time, but the new standard C++0x has now been defined. Rather than a ""big bang"" approach, it is being rolled out gradually as compilers are supporting the new language features. See the <a href=""http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/C++0xFAQ.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C++0x FAQ</a> to see what is new in the language, and check your own compilers FAQs to see which of those features are currently supported.</p>

<h3>Have a Question?</h3>

<p><strong><em>Programming questions are off-topic and should be asked at <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/"">http://stackoverflow.com/</a>.</em></strong> When you ask a question, be sure to include any relevant source code. Try to keep the code as minimalist as possible while still reproducing the problem; often the problem will be found during the process. Try to make sure that the source code compiles, if possible. However, if there are any compiler errors, be sure to indicate:</p>

<ul>
<li>which compiler you are using</li>
<li>exactly what the errors are</li>
<li>on which lines they occur (mark the lines with comments)</li>
</ul>

chkdsk,"CHKDSK is a command on computers running DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows operating systems that displays the file system integrity status of hard disks and floppy disk and can fix logical file system errors. It is similar to the fsck command in Unix. It is short for ""Check disk"". On computers running NT-based versions of Windows, CHKDSK can also check the disk surface for physical errors or bad sectors, a task previously done by SCANDISK.","<p>CHKDSK can be run from the Windows Shell, the Windows Command Prompt or the Windows Recovery Console. One option for CHKDSK is the use of the Command-line/R parameter, which allows the program to repair damage it finds on the hard drive.</p>

<p>Conducting a CHKDSK can take some time, especially if using the /R parameter, and the results are often not visible, for various reasons. The results of a CHKDSK conducted on restart using Windows 2000 or later operating systems are written to the Application Log, with a ""Source"" name of Wininit or Winlogon and can be viewed with the Event Viewer. On the Windows 7 operating system, look for events with a ""Source"" name of ""Chkdsk""</p>

<p>The standard version of CHKDSK supports the following switches :</p>

<pre><code>filename   FAT only. Specifies the file or set of files to check for
           fragmentation. Wildcard characters (* and ?) are allowed.

path    FAT only. Specifies the location of a file or set of files within the
        folder structure of the volume.

size    NTFS only. Changes the log file size to the specified number of 
        kilobytes. Must be used with the /l switch.

volume  FAT and NTFS (NTFS support is unofficially supported but works 
            normally) Specifies the drive letter (followed by a colon), 
            mount point, or volume name.

/c  NTFS only. Skips checking of cycles within the folder structure.

/f  Fixes errors on the volume. The volume must be locked. If CHKDSK 
    cannot lock the volume, it offers to check it the next 
    time the computer starts.

/i  NTFS only. Performs a less vigorous check of index entries.

/l[:size]   NTFS only. Displays current size of the log file. If size is 
            specified, changes the log file to that size (in kilobytes).

/p  Checks disk even if it is not flagged as ""dirty"" 
    (only available in the Recovery Console).

/r  Locates bad sectors and recovers readable information (implies /f and /p)
    If CHKDSK cannot lock the volume, it offers to check it the next time the 
    computer starts.

/v  On FAT: Displays the full path and name of every file on the volume.
    On NTFS: Displays cleanup messages, if any.

/x  NTFS only. Forces the volume to dismount first, if necessary. 
    All opened handles to the volume are then invalid (implies /f ).

/b  NTFS only, since Vista. Clears the list of bad clusters on the volume
    and rescans all clusters for errors (implies /r).

/?  Displays the list of available CHKDSK switches.
</code></pre>

<p>When running CHKDSK from the Recovery Console the options are different. The /p is not read-only as in the standard version but corrects errors :</p>

<pre><code>/p  Fixes errors on the volume. Same as the /f option in standard CHKDSK.

/r  Locates bad sectors and recovers readable information (implies /f and /p)
    Takes much longer to run than /p by itself.

Three-contact versions are known as <em>TRS connectors</em>, where <em>T</em> stands for ""tip"", <em>R</em> stands for ""ring"" and <em>S</em> stands for ""sleeve"". Similarly, two-, four- and five- contact versions are called <em>TS</em>, <em>TRRS</em> and <em>TRRRS connectors</em> respectively.</p>

<p>The phone connector was invented for use in telephone switchboards in the 19th century and is still widely used. In its original configuration, the outside diameter of the ""sleeve"" conductor is 1/4 inch (6.35 millimetres). The ""mini"" connector has a diameter of 3.5 mm (0.14 in) and the ""sub-mini"" connector has a diameter of 2.5 mm (0.098 in).</p>

<p>There are many options that control mysqldump's behavior when dumping MyISAM and InnoDB data, plus accommodations for making the mysqldump's output perform Binary Log Rotation on the Master prior to dumping and preparing Replication Slaves to change replication coordinates (master Log file,master log position) during reload.</p>

<li>To install a new system (Gentoo, for example, can install from a <code>chroot</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>What <code>chroot</code> does is to change what a process considers the root directory, which changes where a process expects to find things - for example, when a process is <code>chroot</code>'d into <code>/home/foo/my-chroot</code>, it can reference the file in <code>/home/foo/my-chroot/bin/sh</code> by using <code>/bin/sh</code>. </p>

<p>This effectively ""fools"" a process so that it is capable of running under a system where the root directory is not the same as what the process expects.</p>

<p>Another consequence is that, in theory (but see below), a process cannot see any deeper than its <code>chroot</code>'d directory, because <code>/..</code> resolves to <code>/</code>.</p>

anti-virus,"Software for protecting against, detecting, and removing viruses, malware, and other potential threats to a computer system.","<p>Anti-virus software can be used on a live, running system, or used to scan an infected hard disk from another computer system.  The general purpose of all anti-virus software is to remove <a href=""http://superuser.com/tags/malware/info"">malware</a> (shortform for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">malicious software</a>).  Most modern anti-virus software is capable of dealing with (but not limited to) viruses, worms, trojan horses, and spyware/adware.</p>

<p>There are a variety of paid and free anti-virus software options for almost all modern operating systems, some of which are better then others.  This is due to the differences in scanning techniques (which can also impact performance of the system) and available virus ""definitions"".</p>

<p>Anti-virus programs normally have several different detection methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>Signature scanner, which tries to match files against signatures. This is generally not very effective because a virus maker does not have to do much to change the unique signature of their virus. Some viruses can change their code every time they are run (polymorphic viruses), making them harder to detect.</li>
<li>Heuristics scanner, which tries to match files against a heuristic (think of it like a fuzzy checksum). This is more effective because it can counteract the virus's attempts to disguise itself.</li>
<li>Behavioral scanner, which tracks the behavior of processes and tries to look for suspicious activity (for example, trying to patch the kernel). </li>

named-ranges,A fixed or dynamically defined range of cells that has been assigned a name by a user. Named ranges are used in Microsoft Excel and similar spreadsheet applications. Named ranges may be referred to in formulas or in code and are useful for convenient reference and improved formula readability.,"<h2>When to Apply <a href=""/questions/tagged/namedranges"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;namedranges&#39;"" rel=""tag"">namedranges</a> Tag:</h2>

<h2>About Named Ranges:</h2>

<p>In Microsoft Excel, named ranges may be defined in several ways. The Name Box, located to the left of the formula bar, may be used to apply a name to the selected range. The Name Manager (accessible on the Formulas ribbon or by pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F3</kbd>) may be used to define a named range as well.</p>

<p>Names defined in the Name Manager may be defined statically, i.e., as an address, such as  </p>

<pre><code>=Sheet1!A1:C3
</code></pre>

<p>Or dynamically, i.e., as a formula, such as  </p>

<pre><code>=INDIRECT(""Sheet1!A1:A""&amp;COUNTA(Sheet1!A:A))
</code></pre>

<p>Dynamically defined named ranges are useful for referring to ranges that may have changing dimensions or location, such as a column in a table where rows and columns are sometimes added or removed.</p>

<p>Named ranges may be used in formulas. For example, where the range <code>A1:A5</code> is named <code>MyNamedRange</code>, the following formulas are the same:</p>

<pre><code>=SUM(A1:A5)
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>=SUM(MyNamedRange)
</code></pre>

<p>Name ranges may also be used in VBA application.</p>

<pre class=""lang-vb prettyprint-override""><code>Dim rng as Range
'MyNamedRange is previously defined named range.
Set rng = Range(""MyNamedRange"")
'Alternative way of defining range object using named range
Set rng = [MyNamedRange]
</code></pre>

<p>An Ethernet crossover cable is a type of Ethernet cable used to connect computing devices together directly.

A cable with connections that ""cross over"" was used to connect two devices of the same type: two hosts or two switches to each other. Owing to the inclusion of Auto-MDIX capability, modern implementations of the Ethernet over twisted pair standards usually no longer require the use of crossover cables.</p>

You can also use Desktop.ini to create an infotip that displays information about the folder and controls some aspects of the folder's behavior, such as specifying localized names for the folder or items in the folder.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Available options</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ConfirmFileOp:</strong> Set this entry to 0 to avoid a ""You Are Deleting a System Folder"" warning when deleting or moving the folder.</li>
<li><strong>NoSharing:</strong>    Not supported under Windows Vista or later. Set this entry to 1 to prevent the folder from being shared.</li>
<li><strong>IconFile</strong> <em>(until Windows XP)</em>: If you want to specify a custom icon for the folder, set this entry to the icon's file name. The .ico file name extension is preferred, but it is also possible to specify .bmp files, or .exe and .dll files that contain icons. If you use a relative path, the icon is available to people who view the folder over the network. You must also set the IconIndex entry.</li>
<li><strong>IconIndex</strong> <em>(until Windows XP)</em>: Set this entry to specify the index for a custom icon. If the file assigned to IconFile only contains a single icon, set IconIndex to 0.</li>
<li><strong>InfoTip:</strong>  Set this entry to an informational text string. It is displayed as an infotip when the cursor hovers over the folder. If the user clicks the folder, the information text is displayed in the folder's information block, below the standard information.</li>
<li><strong>IconResource:</strong> (since Windows Vista) In Windows Vista and later, IconFile and IconIndex parameters are deprecated in favor of the new IconResource.<br>

Its readily identifiable elements consists of the desktop, the taskbar, the Smart menu, the task switcher and the Autoplay feature. On some versions of Windows, it also includes Flip 3D and the charms. However, the Windows shell also implements a shell namespace that enables computer programs running on Windows to access the computer's resources via the hierarchy of shell objects. ""Desktop"" is the top object of the hierarchy; below it there are a number of files and folders stored on the disk, as well as a number of special folders whose contents are either virtual or dynamically created. Recycle Bin, Libraries, Control Panel, This PC and Network are examples of such shell objects.</p>

<p>The Windows shell, as known today, is an evolution of what is started with Windows 95, released in 1995. It is intimately identified with File Explorer, a Windows component that can browse the whole shell namespace.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

<p>At any given time, two or three Long Term Support (LTS) versions are supported as well as the most recent prior non-LTS version. If the latest stable release is non-LTS, then two non-LTS releases are supported: the current and the prior one. If the latest stable release is an LTS, then only the prior non-LTS release and the LTS releases are supported.</p>

<p>Support means that security and bug fix updates are continuing to be released to the update repositories. When support is dropped for an old release, responsibility for fixing any bugs or security issues is left up to the user.</p>

<p>The latest table of currently supported and unsupported releases can be found on the <a href=""https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Releases page of the Ubuntu Wiki</a>.</p>

<p>If your operating system is Ubuntu, you can run the following command to check the support status of the system's installed packages:</p>

vlookup,"VLookup is a Microsoft Excel function that searches for a value in the left-most column of a table array (a range), and returns a value in the same row based on the column number from which the user wishes to retrieve the value.","<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>Click on an empty cell in Microsoft Excel and type <code>=VLOOKUP</code>. Click the <code>fx</code> icon to view interactive help that will assist you in filling out the parameters, <em>or</em> fill out the parameters as follows:</p>

<p><code>=VLOOKUP(lookup_value,table_array,col_index_num,range_lookup)</code></p>

<p><code>lookup_value</code>: This should be either a literal value like <code>12</code> or <code>""hello""</code>, or any function that returns a reference to a <strong>single cell</strong>. Do not try to use a Range here; if you think you need a range here, you probably need to use a different worksheet function.</p>

<p><code>table_array</code>: This should be a rectangular array of cells containing at least <strong>two columns</strong> (a ""key"" column and a ""value"" column). The leftmost column in the table array is where Excel will look for the value specified by the <code>lookup_value</code> parameter (see above). The ""value"" column will be read from in the first row where the <code>lookup_value</code> is found in the ""key"" column. This read value will then be returned as the result of the <code>VLOOKUP()</code> function.</p>

<p><code>col_index_number</code>: This should be a number greater than 0. If the value is 1, the <code>VLOOKUP()</code> function will return values from the leftmost column in the <code>table_array</code> range. If the value is 2, it will return values from the next column to the right, and so on. Do not specify negative values, values less than 1, or values greater than the total number of columns in <code>table_array</code>.</p>

<p><code>range_lookup</code>: This parameter can be omitted, otherwise it must be <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code>. If <code>TRUE</code> or omitted, an approximate match is returned. In other words, if an exact match is not found, the next largest value that is less than lookup_value is returned. If <code>FALSE</code>, VLOOKUP will find an exact match.</p>

<h3>Pitfalls</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>If you need to return <strong>multiple values</strong> (summed, counted, or otherwise aggregated) from the <code>table_array</code> for one individual row, you need to use another worksheet function, such as <code>SUMIF()</code> or <code>SUMIFS()</code>. You can also use a pivot table for this functionality.</p></li>
<li><p>If you need multiple <code>lookup_value</code>s for a single row, you need to use another worksheet function or set of conditionals.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Alternatives</h3>

<p>The most versatile alternative is a combination of <a href=""http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/index-function-HP010342608.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">INDEX</a> and <a href=""http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/match-function-HP010062414.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MATCH</a>.</p>

<pre><code>=INDEX ( array , row number )
=MATCH (  lookup value , lookup array , match type )
=INDEX( array, MATCH( lookup value, lookup array, match type)
</code></pre>

<p>Simply put - <code>INDEX(column to return, MATCH( lookup value, lookup array, match type))</code>. This will lookup the matching row for the index column. </p>

<p>You can reverse it like this <code>=INDEX(MATCH(lookup value, lookup array, matchtype), row to return)</code> which looks up the matching column for the index row</p>

<h3>Version Support</h3>

<p><code>VLOOKUP()</code> is known to be supported from at least Microsoft Excel 95 (version 7.0), perhaps earlier, up through and including the latest version as of this writing, Excel 2013. It is also supported on Mac OS X versions of Office.</p>

true-type-fonts,"Use for questions about TrueType fonts, including for example, fonts or characters, the TrueType font format, rendering of TrueType fonts, or TrueType font files (.ttf, .ttc, .tte, etc.).","<p>TrueType is an outline font standard that has become the predominant font format for MacOS/OSX and Windows.  </p>

<p><strong>Outline Fonts</strong></p>

<p>An outline font is a vector character image (mathematically-defined shape), that can be rendered at any size, as opposed to a bitmap character image that is defined pixel-by-pixel at a specific size.  A TrueType font is essentially a program that defines each character outline based on straight line segments and Bezier curves, and then uses hinting to adjust the shape to fit the available pixels at a given font size.</p>

<p>As screen rendering techniques have evolved for increasingly higher resolutions, much of the mapping of character outlines to pixels is done by the operating system using sub-pixel rendering.  Microsoft and Apple each have their own, and ignore much of the hinting contained in the font.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of competing vector font formats that stem from work and collaboration by Adobe Systems, Apple, and Microsoft.  Type 1 fonts used in Postscript were created by Adobe.  TrueType was originally developed by Apple to replace Type 1, and then was enhanced in collaboration with Microsoft.  OpenType fonts were built on TrueType and Type 1 by Microsoft in collaboration with Adobe.</p>

<p>There are some basic differences in how the shapes are defined in Type 1 and TrueType.  OpenType can include either basis.</p>

<p>In addition, TrueType was extended with the TrueType Collection to allow combining multiple fonts into a single file to share outlines.  Another extension is Microsoft's Private Character Editor that allows the user to create custom characters. </p>

<p><strong>TrueType Filename Extensions</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>.ttf is used for regular TrueType fonts or an OpenType font based on TrueType outlines</li>
<li>.ttc is used for a TrueType Collection</li>
<li>.tte is used for a font file created by the Private Character Editor (although these files are normally hidden by the system)</li>
<li>various other extensions used in MacOS/OSX have been phased out, but questions about the old extensions would still be on-topic</li>

bash-scripting,Bash scripting is making scripts in the Bash shell language.,"<p>Bash has several features which allow making small uncompiled programs (scripts) to automate functionality. It features basic programming constructs like variables, IF-statements and loops.</p>

<p>Bash scripts are usually created in files with the <code>.sh</code> extension. To make the file executable as it were a program, put the following line at the top of the file:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
</code></pre>

<p>This will instruct the kernel to start a Bash shell and use the rest of the file as input. After adding the 'shebang' line, change the permissions of the file to be executable with <code>chmod +x filename.sh</code>. You can then run the script with <code>./filename.sh</code>.</p>

<h2>Example IF-statement</h2>

<pre><code>VARIABLE1='hello world'
if [[ $VARIABLE1 == 'hello world' ]]
then
  echo 'Hello World!' 
fi
</code></pre>

<p>In this example we see:</p>

<ul>
<li>Variable $VARIABLE1 is set to the value <code>hello world</code></li>
<li>The content of $VARIABLE1 is matched against the string <code>hello world</code></li>
<li>If this is true, then print <code>Hello World!</code> to the screen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Loop</h2>

<p>Several kinds of loops can created in bash:</p>

<h3>For loop</h3>

<pre><code>VARIABLE1=""anna bob charlie dave eve""
for NAME in $VARIABLE1
do
  echo $NAME
done
</code></pre>

<p>The for statement will iterate through the names in $VARIABLE1 and run the code block between <code>do</code> and <code>done</code> for each name. This will output all 5 names separated by newlines.</p>

<p>You can also create a C-style for-loop:</p>

<pre><code>for ((i = 0 ; i &lt; 10 ; i++)); do
  echo $i
done
</code></pre>

<p>This will print numbers 1 through 9 separated by newlines.</p>

<h3>While loop</h3>

<pre><code>VARIABLE1=1

while [ $VARIABLE1 -lt 10 ]
do
  echo ""$VARIABLE1""
  VARIABLE1=$[$VARIABLE1+1]
done
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Recover previous versions    You can now recover versions of files that you closed without saving. This is helpful when you forget to manually save, when you save changes that you didn't mean to save, or when you just want to revert to an earlier version of your workbook. Read more about recovering files.</p></li>
<li><p>Protected view    Excel 2010 includes a Protected View, so you can make more informed decisions before exposing your computer to possible vulnerabilities.

Make fast, effective comparisons from lists of data
In Excel 2010, new features such as sparklines and slicers, and improvements to PivotTables and other existing features, can help you to discover patterns or trends in your data.</p>

<h2>Sparklines</h2>

<p>You can use sparklines—tiny charts that fit in a cell—to visually summarize trends alongside data. Because sparklines show trends in a small amount of space, they are especially useful for dashboards or other places where you need to show a snapshot of your business in an easy-to-understand visual format. In the following image, the sparklines that appear in the Trend column let you see at a glance how each department performed in May.</p>

<h2>Improved PivotTables</h2>

<p>PivotTables are now easier to use and more responsive. Key improvements include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Performance enhancements    In Excel 2010, multi-threading helps speed up data retrieval, sorting, and filtering in PivotTables.</p></li>
<li><p>PivotTable labels    It's now possible to fill down labels in a PivotTable. You can also repeat labels in PivotTables to display item captions of nested fields in all rows and columns. Watch a video about repeating item labels.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced filtering    You can use slicers to quickly filter data in a PivotTable with the click of a button and see which filters are applied without having to open additional menus. In addition, the filter interface includes a handy search box that can help you to find what you need among potentially thousands (or even millions) of items in your PivotTables.</p></li>
<li><p>Write-back support    In Excel 2010, you can change values in the OLAP PivotTable Values area and have them written back to the Analysis Services cube on the OLAP server. You can use the write-back feature in what-if mode and then roll back the changes when you no longer need them, or you can save the changes. You can use the write-back feature with any OLAP provider that supports the UPDATE CUBE statement.</p></li>
<li><p>Show Values As feature    The Show Values As feature includes a number of new, automatic calculations, such as % of Parent Row Total, % of Parent Column Total, % of Parent Total, % Running Total, Rank Smallest to Largest, and Rank Largest to Smallest. Watch a video about changes to the Show Values As feature.</p></li>
<li><p>PivotChart improvements    It is now easier to interact with PivotChart reports. Specifically, it's easier to filter data directly in a PivotChart and to reorganize the layout of a PivotChart by adding and removing fields. Similarly, with a single click, you can hide all field buttons on the PivotChart report. Watch a video about using interactive controls in a PivotChart report.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Slicers</h2>

<p>Slicers are visual controls that let you quickly filter data in a PivotTable in an interactive, intuitive way. If you insert a slicer, you can use buttons to quickly segment and filter the data to display just what you need. In addition, when you apply more than one filter to your PivotTable, you no longer have to open a list to see which filters are applied to the data. Instead, it is shown there on the screen in the slicer. You can make slicers match your workbook formatting and easily reuse them in other PivotTables, PivotCharts, and cube functions.</p>

<h2>Improved conditional formatting</h2>

<p>Conditional formatting makes it easy to highlight interesting cells or ranges of cells, emphasize unusual values, and visualize data by using data bars, color scales, and icon sets. Excel 2010 includes even greater formatting flexibility:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>New icon sets    First introduced in Office Excel 2007, icon sets let you display icons for different categories of data, based on whatever threshold you determine. For example, you can use a green up arrow to represent higher values, a yellow sideways arrow to represent middle values, and a red down arrow to represent lower values. In Excel 2010, you have access to more icon sets, including triangles, stars, and boxes. You can also mix and match icons from different sets and more easily hide icons from view—for example, you might choose to show icons only for high profit values and omit them for middle and lower values.</p></li>
<li><p>More options for data bars    Excel 2010 comes with new formatting options for data bars. You can apply solid fills or borders to the data bar, or set the bar direction from right-to-left instead of left-to-right. In addition, data bars for negative values appear on the opposite side of an axis from positive values, as shown here.</p></li>
<li><p>Other improvements    When specifying criteria for conditional or data validation rules, it's now possible to refer to values in other worksheets in your workbook.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Obtain powerful analysis from your desktop</h2>

<p>Whether at work or home, you need to be able to manipulate and analyze your data in a way that gives you new insight or helps you make better decisions—and the faster you can finish your task the better. Excel 2010 provides new and improved analysis tools that enable you to do just that.</p>

<h2>PowerPivot for Excel add-in</h2>

<p>If you need to analyze large quantities of data, you can download the Microsoft SQL Server PowerPivot for Excel add-in, which adds a PowerPivot tab to the Excel ribbon. 
With PowerPivot for Excel, you can import millions of rows of data from multiple data sources into a single Excel workbook, create relationships between heterogeneous data, create calculated columns and measures using formulas, build PivotTables and PivotCharts, and then further analyze the data so that you can make timely business decisions— all without requiring IT assistance. </p>

<h2>Improved Solver add-in</h2>

<p>Excel 2010 includes a new version of the Solver add-in, which you can use to find optimal solutions in what-if analysis. Solver has an improved user interface, a new Evolutionary Solver, based on genetic algorithms, that handles models with any Excel functions, new global optimization options, better linear programming and nonlinear optimization methods, and new Linearity and Feasibility reports. In addition, the Solver add-in is now available in a 64-bit version. 
For more detailed help on Solver from Frontline Systems, visit Solver Help at www.solver.com.</p>

<h2>Improved function accuracy</h2>

<p>In response to feedback from the academic, engineering, and scientific communities, Excel 2010 now includes a set of more accurate statistical and other functions. Certain existing functions have also been renamed to better describe what they do. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Accuracy improvements    A number of functions have been optimized to improve accuracy. For example, Excel 2010 returns more accurate results for the beta and chi-squared distributions.</p></li>
<li><p>More consistent functions    Certain statistical functions have been renamed so that they are more consistent with the function definitions of the scientific community and with other function names in Excel. The new function names also more accurately describe their functionality. Workbooks created in earlier versions of Excel will continue to work despite these name changes, because the original functions still exist in a Compatibility category.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Improved filter capabilities</h2>

<p>In addition to slicers, which are described earlier in this article, Excel 2010 comes with new features that make it easier to sort and filter data. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>New search filter    When you filter data in Excel tables, PivotTables, and PivotCharts, you can use a new search box, which helps you to find what you need in long lists. For example, to find a specific product in a catalog that stocks over 100,000 items, start by typing your search term, and relevant items instantly appear in the list. You can narrow the results further by deselecting the items you don't want to see.</p></li>
<li><p>Filter and sort regardless of location    In an Excel table, table headers replace regular worksheet headers at the top of columns when you scroll down in a long table. AutoFilter buttons now remain visible along with table headers in your table columns, so you can sort and filter data quickly without having to scroll all the way back up to the top of the table.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>64-bit Excel</h2>

<p>Excel 2010 is available in a 64-bit version, which means that power users and analysts can create bigger, more complex workbooks. By using a 64-bit version, you can address physical memory (RAM) that is above the 2-gigabyte (GB) limit that exists in the 32-bit version of Excel. </p>

<h2>Performance enhancements</h2>

<p>Performance improvements in Excel 2010 can help you to interact with your data more efficiently. Specific investments include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>General improvements    In response to customer feedback, Excel 2010 improves performance in a number of areas. For example, Excel 2010 is more responsive when you move and resize charts, work in Page Layout view, and interact with shapes on the worksheet. </p></li>
<li><p>Support for large data sets    Excel 2010 handles workbooks that contain massive amounts of data more efficiently. Specifically, it takes less time to perform activities commonly performed on large data sets, such as filtering and sorting the data, copy and pasting it from one worksheet to another, and using the Fill feature to copy formulas. </p></li>
<li><p>Multicore improvements    Multithreading improvements in Excel 2010 help to speed up the process of retrieving, sorting, and filtering data in PivotTables and Excel tables. In addition, opening and saving large files is generally faster than before.</p></li>
<li><p>Faster calculation    If workbooks are critical to key business processes in your organization, it’s important that calculation speed doesn’t become a bottleneck. To achieve faster calculation performance, Excel 2010 includes support for asynchronous user-defined functions, which can run simultaneously without using multiple Excel calculation threads. This is valuable when you are importing data into worksheets in custom ways, and in high-performance computing (HPC) scenarios.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Create workbooks with more visual impact</h2>

<p>No matter how much data you work with, it's important to have tools at your disposal that let you explore and convey ideas with compelling visuals, such as charts, diagrams, pictures, or screenshots.</p>

<h2>Improved charting</h2>

<p>It's easier to work with charts in Excel 2010. Specific improvements include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>New charting limits    In Excel 2010, the limitation on the number of data points that can be created on a chart has been removed. The number of data points is limited only by available memory. This enables people—particularly those of you in the scientific community—to more effectively visualize and analyze large sets of data. </p></li>
<li><p>Quick access to formatting options    In Excel 2010, you can instantly access formatting options by double-clicking a chart element.</p></li>
<li><p>Macro recording for chart elements    In Office Excel 2007, recording a macro while formatting a chart or other object did not produce any macro code. In Excel 2010, however, you can use the macro recorder to record formatting changes to charts and other objects.
Read more about creating a chart. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Support for equations</h2>

<p>You can use the new equation editing tools in Excel 2010 to insert common mathematical equations into your worksheets or to build up your own equations by using a library of math symbols. You can also insert new equations inside of text boxes and other shapes. To get started, on the Insert tab, in the Symbols group, click the arrow next to Equation. </p>

<h2>More themes</h2>

<p>In Excel 2010, there are more themes and styles than ever before. These elements can help you apply professional designs consistently across your workbooks and other Microsoft Office documents. Once you select a theme, Excel 2010 does the design work. Text, charts, graphics, tables, and drawing objects all change to reflect the theme you have selected, so that all elements in your workbook visually complement one another.</p>

<h2>Paste with live preview</h2>

<p>The paste with live preview feature enables you to save time when reusing content within Excel 2010 or across other programs. You can use it to preview various paste options, such as Keep Source Column Widths, No Borders, or Keep Source Formatting. The live preview enables you to visually determine how your pasted content will look before you actually paste it in the worksheet. When you move your pointer over Paste Options to preview results, you'll see a menu containing items that change contextually to best fit the content you are reusing. ScreenTips provide additional information to help you make the right decision.</p>

<h2>Improved picture-editing tools</h2>

<p>Communicating ideas in Excel 2010 isn't always about showing numbers or charts. If you want to use photos, drawings, or SmartArt to communicate visually, you can take advantage of the following features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Screenshots    Quickly take a screenshot and add it to your workbook, and then use the tools on the Picture Tools tab to edit and improve the screenshot. </p></li>
<li><p>New SmartArt graphic layouts    With new picture layouts, you can tell your story with photographs. For example, use the Captioned Picture layout to show pictures with nice-looking captions underneath. </p></li>
<li><p>Picture corrections    Fine tune the color of a picture, or adjust its brightness, contrast, or sharpness—all without having to use additional photo-editing software. </p></li>
<li><p>New and improved artistic effects    Apply different artistic effects to your picture to make it look more like a sketch, drawing, or painting. New artistic effects include Pencil Sketch, Line Drawing, Watercolor Sponge, Mosaic Bubbles, Glass, Pastels Smooth, Plastic Wrap, Photocopy, Paint Strokes, and many more. </p></li>
<li><p>Better compression and cropping    You now have better control of the image quality and compression tradeoffs, so that you can make the right choice for the medium (print, screen, e-mail) that your workbook will be used for. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Collaborate on workbooks in new ways</h2>

<p>Excel 2010 offers improved ways to publish, edit, and share workbooks with other people in your organization.</p>

<h2>Co-authoring workbooks</h2>

<p>With Excel Web App, which is part of Office Web Apps, it’s now possible for different people to edit a workbook at the same time from different locations. If you’re in a small company or working on your own from home or school, all you need is a free Windows Live account to simultaneously author workbooks with others. Corporate users in companies running Microsoft SharePoint 2010 technology can also use this functionality within their firewall. </p>

<h2>Improved Excel Services</h2>

<p>If your organization previously used Excel Services to share Excel workbooks on SharePoint Server sites, take note of the following improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Improved user experience    Some of the more visible changes include the ability to refresh elements of a page, instead of having every change require a page refresh, and the addition of scroll bars, which let you easily scroll throughout the worksheet.</p></li>
<li><p>Better integration with SharePoint 2010 features    In this version of Excel Services, you get better integration with important SharePoint 2010 features, including security, content management, version control, data connection management, and service administration features. In addition, Excel Services better integrates with the built-in business intelligence capabilities in SharePoint.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved support for workbook features    Previously, if a workbook contained unsupported features, it couldn't be opened at all in the browser. Now, if a workbook contains an Excel feature that isn't supported, that workbook will, in most cases, open in the browser. In addition, more Excel features are supported in Excel Services, including new Excel 2010 features such as sparklines and slicers.</p></li>
<li><p>More support for developing applications    Developers and non-developers alike can take advantage of new tools, such as a REST application programming interface, for building business applications.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Accessibility Checker</h2>

<p>The new Accessibility Checker tool in Excel 2010 enables you to find and fix issues that can make it difficult for people with disabilities to read or interact with your workbook. You can open the Accessibility Checker by clicking the File tab, clicking Check for Issues, and then clicking Check Accessibility. Errors and warnings will appear in a task pane. You can then review the issues and see which ones you need to fix.
In addition to the Accessibility Checker, you can add alternative text to more objects in your worksheet, including Excel tables and PivotTables. This information is useful to people with visual impairments who may be unable to easily or fully see the object.</p>

<h2>Improved language tools</h2>

<p>In the Excel Options dialog box, multilingual users can quickly set preferences for editing, display, ScreenTip, and Help languages. And, changing your language settings in Excel automatically changes them across all applicable Microsoft Office 2010 applications. If you don't have the software or keyboard layout installed that you need, you are notified, and links are provided to make it easier to quickly resolve such issues.</p>

<h2>Extend workbooks in new ways</h2>

<p>If you develop custom workbook solutions, you can take advantage of new ways to extend those solutions.</p>

<h2>Improved programmability features</h2>

<p>Improvements for developers include: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Changes to the XLL SDK     The XLL Software Development Kit (SDK)
now supports calling new worksheet functions, developing asynchronous
user-defined functions, developing cluster-safe user-defined
functions that can be offloaded to a compute cluster, and building
64-bit XLL add-ins. </p></li>
<li><p>VBA improvements    Excel 2010 has a number of
features that will enable you to migrate any remaining Excel 4.0
macros you may have to VBA. Improvements include better performance
for print-related methods and chart properties not previously
accessible with VBA. </p></li>
<li><p>Better user-interface extensibility    If you
develop custom workbook solutions, you have more options for
programmatically customizing both the ribbon and the new Backstage
view. For example, you can programmatically activate tabs on the
ribbon, and make custom tabs behave similarly to built-in contextual
tabs, where tabs only appear when specific events occur. In addition,
you can make custom ribbon groups grow and shrink as the ribbon is
resized and customize context menus with rich controls. You can also
add custom UI and other elements to the Backstage view . </p></li>
<li><p>Changes to the Open XML SDK    The Open XML SDK 2.0 now supports schema-level
objects, in addition to the part-level support introduced in the Open
XML SDK 1.0. This makes it easier to programmatically manipulate
workbooks and other documents outside the Office 2010 desktop
applications—for example, as part of a server-based solution. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Support for high-performance computing</h2>

<p>Many organizations rely on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters to increase computational scale. For example, a financial firm might use compute clusters to speed up long-running, calculation-intensive financial models. Excel 2010 includes the ability to integrate with HPC clusters. When a supported cluster is available, users can instruct Excel to use that cluster by selecting a connector and configuring a name to use in the Advanced options of the Excel Options dialog box.</p>

<p>The first preview version of MySQL Workbench was released in September 2005, and was not included in the MySQL GUI Tools Bundle. Development was started again in 2007 and MySQL Workbench was set to become the MySQL GUI flagship product.
Version numbering was started 5.0 to emphasis the fact that MySQL Workbench was developed as the successor to DBDesigner4.</p>

<p><strong>MySQL Workbench 5.0 and 5.1</strong> </p>

<p>MySQL Workbench 5.0 and 5.1 are specialized visual database design tools for the MySQL database. While MySQL Workbench 5.0 was a MS Windows only product cross-platform support was added to MySQL Workbench 5.1 and later.</p>

<p><strong>MySQL Workbench 5.2</strong></p>

<p>Starting with MySQL Workbench 5.2 the application has evolved to a general database GUI application. Apart from physical database modeling it features a SQL Editor, database migration tools, and a database server administration interface, replacing the old MySQL GUI Tools Bundle.</p>

<p><strong>MySQL Workbench 6.2</strong></p>

<p>On August 19, 2014, the MySQL Workbench Team announced its first public beta release of Version 6.2. The first general-availability release was made on September 23, 2014. New features are shortcut buttons for common operations, ""pinning"" of the results tab, Microsoft Access Migration, MySQL Fabric Integration, Spatial View Panel to visualize spatial and geometry data, Geometry Data Viewer, Result Set Width, SQL editor tabs are properly saved, Shared Snippets, a new Run SQL Script dialog, Model Script Attachments, Client Connections management has a new ""Show Details"" window where more information about connections, locks, and attributes is displayed, performance columns can display sizes in KB, MB, or GB, the migration wizard can resume operations of data copying if interrupted, MySQL connection password is remembered across the MySQL Workbench session.</p>

<p><strong>MySQL Workbench 6.3</strong></p>

<p>On March 5, 2015, the MySQL Workbench Team announced its first public beta release of Version 6.3. The first general-availability release was made on April 23, 2015.

<h3>Licensing and editions</h3>

<p>MySQL Workbench is the first MySQL family of products that offer two different editions - an open source and a proprietary edition.[25] The ""Community Edition"" is a full featured product that is not crippled in any way. Being the foundation for all other editions it will benefit from all future development efforts. The proprietary ""Standard Edition"" extends the Community Edition with a series of modules and plugins.</p>

<p>As this business decision was announced soon after the takeover of MySQL by Sun Microsystems, this has caused speculation in the press about the future licensing of the MySQL database.</p>

<h3>Community reception and reviews</h3>

<p>Since its introduction MySQL Workbench has become popular within the MySQL community. It is now the second most downloaded product from the MySQL website with more than 250,000 downloads a month. Before that it was voted Database Tool of the Year 2009 on Developer.com.</p>

<p>MySQL Workbench has been reviewed by the open source community and print magazines.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>About the game</h2>
  
  <p>Minecraft is developed by Markus Persson. It's been under development since about May 10, 2009. You can read the full credits here, or read about support and frequently asked questions here.</p>
  
  <h2>Origins</h2>
  
  <p>I started Minecraft after playing some Infiniminer with a couple of people from TigSource. I realized that a game that simple yet that dynamic had a lot of potential to turn into a really great game, and kept coming up with things I wanted to change and stuff I wanted to add.</p>
  
  <p>I had recently quit my job as a game developer to be able to focus more on indie game dev during my free time, and I was looking for a new game to develop. I had a few ideas floating around, but most required really long development times.</p>
  
  <p>These two factors led to Minecraft.</p>
  
  <h2>Development and philosophy</h2>
  
  <h3>Waterfall is dead, long live agile!</h3>
  
  <p>I've got a few plans and visions, but my only true design decision is to keep it fun and accessible. There's no design doc, but there are two lists; one for bugs, and one for features I want to add but think I might forget.</p>
  
  <p>I make sure to play the game a lot, and I've built my share of towers, and flooded my share of caves. If something ever doesn't feel fun, I'll remove it. I believe that I can combine enough fun, accessibility and building blocks for this game to be a huge melting pot of emergent gameplay.</p>
  
  <p>I strongly believe that all good stories have a conflict, and that all good games tell a good story regardless of if it's pre-written or emergent. Free building mode is fine and dandy, but for many people it will ultimately become boring once you've got it figured out. It's like playing a first person shooter in god mode, or giving yourself infinite funds in a strategy game.. a lack of challenge kills the fun.</p>
  
  <p>For survival mode, I'd rather make the game too difficult than too easy. That also means I'm going to have to include some way of winning the game (or some other climax) to prevent it becoming too exhausting.</p>
  
  <p>But if it's no fun, I'll redesign.</p>
  
  <h2>The future</h2>
  
  <p>I plan on developing Minecraft until it's a finished complete game, with a downloadable client (with fullscreen mode), custom key re mappings and possibly modding support.</p>
  
  <p>For as long as people enjoy and purchase the game, I will develop extensions after the game is done.</p>
  
  <p>Once sales start dying and a minimum time has passed, I will release the game source code as some kind of open source. I'm not very happy with the draconian nature of (L)GPL, nor do I believe the other licenses have much merit other than to boost the egos of the original authors, so I might just possibly release it all as public domain.</p>

windows-8-preview,"Developer/Consumer/Release Preview of Windows 8. For non-preview questions, use [windows-8] instead as this tag will gradually fade out when the preview time-bombs.","<p>Windows 8 is the name for Microsoft's 2012 version of the Windows operating system. During the //build/ conference in September 2011, Microsoft released a developer preview version of <a href=""/questions/tagged/windows-8"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;windows-8&#39;"" rel=""tag"">windows-8</a> to let developers come up to speed with the new Metro UI look and design philosophy (previously seen in Windows Phone 7, Zune HD, the Xbox Dashboard, and Media Center) and its new underlying runtime: <a href=""/questions/tagged/winrt"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;winrt&#39;"" rel=""tag"">winrt</a>.</p>

<p>The main feature that was shown is the extensively redesigned user interface, optimized for touch as well as for use with mice and keyboards. A new ""Start Screen"", similar to the one in Windows Phone 7, includes live application tiles. It replaces the Start Menu, being triggered by the Start button, Charms bar, or click in the lower-left-hand corner, and is also the first screen shown on startup. The user can go to the regular desktop by choosing the ""Desktop"" tile, opening a traditional desktop-based application, or pressing <kbd>Windows</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8e/Windows_8_Start_Screen.png"" alt=""the Windows 8 Start Screen, from the Release Preview""></p>

<p>Windows 8 has a new developer platform, which allows Metro (aka ""Windows 8 Style"" or ""Modern UI"") apps to be developed in .NET languages or JavaScript and HTML, through use of the new Windows Runtime (WinRT).</p>

<p>The new applications run in full-screen, but two of them can be displayed side-by-side using ""Snap"". Examples of new applications that include a Twitter client, a weather application, a stock-tracking application, an RSS news feeder, and a virtual piano.</p>

<p>The new interface is primarily designed for 16:9 screen resolutions, with 1366×768 and larger screens able to display two Windows 8 applications. 1024×768 screens can display one Windows 8 application in full-screen, and 1024×600 screens can only use the traditional Windows desktop.</p>

<p>Windows 8 also adds support for the first time for ARM processors (through the new Windows RT edition), in addition to continuing support for traditional x86 processors.</p>

<p>Mike Angiulo confirmed at Computex 2011 that Windows 8 will use OEM Activation 3.0 instead of Windows 7 OEM Activation 2.1, which will make it less prone to cracks.</p>

<hr>

<p>Since the Developer/Consumer/Release Preview is pre-release code and not necessarily representative of the the questions people with ask about the release version, any questions specific to the Windows 8 preview should be tagged as <a href=""/questions/tagged/windows-8-preview"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;windows-8-preview&#39;"" rel=""tag"">windows-8-preview</a>.</p>

It was released along with Windows 8 in October 2012 as both Modern and desktop apps, and for Windows 7 in February 2013 (desktop version only). It does not run on earlier versions of Windows.</p>

<p>IE10 adds support for many new CSS3 and HTML5 features, and on Windows 8 includes a built-in Flash Player. The user interface in the desktop version is largely unchanged from IE9, with the exception of some minor refinements.</p>

<p>On Windows 8, IE10 is also available as a ""Metro"" application, which uses a completely different UI, designed to be touch-friendly and to be hidden when not in use. This version of IE10 cannot use any add-ons or plug-ins, except for a limited version of the built-in Flash Player.</p>

<h1>Development History</h1>

<p>Though originally Windows-only, SecureCRT was <a href=""https://www.vandyke.com/aboutus/news/pressreleases/securecrt/securecrt66o.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ported to Mac OS X in 2010</a> with version 6.6, and subsequently <a href=""https://www.vandyke.com/aboutus/news/pressreleases/securecrt/securecrt67.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ported to Linux in 2011</a> with version 6.7.</p>

<p>SecureCRT is a follow-on to a program called CRT which originally spoke only Telnet and rlogin. CRT first shipped in 1995 for Windows 95 and Windows NT. The modem and serial communication features came in later versions of CRT. SecureCRT was a premium variant of CRT, adding support for the SSH and Telnet over SSL protocols. The two programs were offered in parallel for many years, but eventually CRT was dropped from the product line.</p>

<p>Mac OS Classic is a graphical operating system by Apple, used on their Macintosh line of personal computers from 1984 to 2000. Originally called simply <strong>System</strong>, it was renamed to Mac OS in version 7.6. Since 2001, it's been replaced by OS X, technically version 10 of Mac OS, but architecturally a major departure from its predecessor.</p>

<p>Mac OS was notable for differing from other contemporary operating systems by being completely graphical - it had no command-line interface. This was done in order to minimise the amount of technical know-how required to operate the computer. Actions that on other operating systems required accepting input from (or displaying information to) the user in the form of textual commands and prompts, were accomplished in Mac OS with graphical icons and mouse gestures. To provide such functionality at a low level (for instance, during boot time), portions of the operating system were kept in ROM on the motherboard. As a result, only computers manufactured or licensed by Apple were able to boot Mac OS.</p>

<p>Mac OS Classic initially ran on Motorola's 68000 series of microprocessors. Later versions added support for the PowerPC architecture as Apple started using it in Macintoshes. Early versions of OS X (up to 10.4) included a compatibility layer called Classic Environment that allowed Mac OS Classic applications to be run on PowerPC-based Macs.</p>

","<h1>Ant</h1>

<p><a href=""http://ant.apache.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Apache Ant</a> is a <a href=""http://java.oracle.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Java</a> open-source library and command-line tool whose mission is to drive processes described in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XML</a> build files as <a href=""http://ant.apache.org/manual/targets.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">targets and extension points</a> dependent upon each other. The main known usage of Ant is the build of Java applications.</p>

<p>Ant supplies a number of <a href=""http://ant.apache.org/manual/tasksoverview.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">built-in tasks</a> allowing to <a href=""http://ant.apache.org/manual/tasksoverview.html#compile"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">compile</a>, <a href=""http://ant.apache.org/manual/tasksoverview.html#archive"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">assemble</a>, <a href=""http://ant.apache.org/manual/tasksoverview.html#testing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">test</a> and <a href=""http://ant.apache.org/manual/tasksoverview.html#exec"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">run</a> applications. Although primarily aimed at building Java applications, Ant can also be used effectively to build non-Java software, for instance C or C++ applications. More generally, Ant can be used to pilot any type of process which can be described in terms of targets, <a href=""http://ant.apache.org/manual/develop.html#writingowntask"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">tasks</a>, and <a href=""http://ant.apache.org/manual/develop.html#writingowntask"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">macros</a>. It's a standard and effective framework which transforms a development structure of project to deployment structure.</p>

<p>The Windows ADK is new for Windows® 8. Tools that were previously available in the Windows OEM Preinstallation Kit and Windows Automated Installation Kit are now available in the Windows ADK.</p>

<p>It is basically composed by Windows Deployment Service and Windows Assessment Service:</p>

<p><strong>Windows Deployment Overview</strong></p>

<p>This scenario models the work of OEMs and IT professionals who customize and automate the large-scale installation of Windows, such as on a factory floor, or across an organization. The Windows ADK supports this work with the deployment tools that were previously released as part of the OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK) and the Windows Automated Installation Kit (AIK). The deployment tools in the Windows ADK help you to perform the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create a customized Windows PE environment that you can use to deploy Windows to computers.</p></li>
<li><p>Customize aspects of Windows and add your own branding, applications, and settings by using Windows System Image Manager (Windows SIM).</p></li>

<p>This scenario models the work of OEMs, IHVs, and IT professionals who measure the operational characteristics of a computer, including its performance, reliability, and functionality. Assessments help you make these measurements, diagnose problems, and determine how to make improvements. Assessments can help reduce costs by identifying potential issues as you create your hardware and software experiences. By using these tools, you can help ensure that the hardware and software that you develop are responsive and of high quality.</p>

<p>Assessments help you perform the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Assess performance aspects of a single computer using the Windows® Assessment Console.</p></li>
<li><p>Assess performance aspects of multiple computers in a networked or lab environment using Windows® Assessment Services.</p></li>

The MD5 hash (or checksum) functions as a compact digital fingerprint of a file. As with all such hashing algorithms, there is theoretically an unlimited number of files that will have any given MD5 hash. However, it is very unlikely that any two non-identical files in the real world will have the same MD5 hash, unless they have been specifically created to have the same hash. The underlying MD5 algorithm is no longer deemed secure, thus while md5sum is well-suited for e.g. identifying known files in situations that are not security related, it should not be relied on if there is a chance that files have been purposefully and maliciously tampered. In the latter case, use of a newer hashing tool such as sha256sum is highly recommended.</p>

<p>Virtually any non-malicious change to a file will cause its MD5 hash to change; therefore md5sum is used to verify the integrity of files. Most commonly, md5sum is used to verify that a file has not changed as a result of a faulty file transfer, a disk error or non-malicious meddling. The md5sum program is installed by default in most Unix, Linux, and Unix-like operating systems or compatibility layers. Other operating systems, including Microsoft Windows and BSD variants — such as Mac OS X - have similar utilities.</p>

The Start screen replaces the Start menu, is triggered by the Start button on tablets or the Windows key on keyboards, and is also the first screen shown on startup. The user can go to the regular desktop by choosing the ""Desktop"" tile or a traditional desktop-based application.</p>

<p>Windows 8 has a new developer platform called Windows Runtime, or WinRT, which is specifically used for designing new Windows 8 ""Metro"" apps. However, following a trademark dispute with the German company Metro AG, ""Metro"" apps are now officially referred to as ""Modern UI"" or ""Windows Store"" apps. This developer platform supports developing using C++/CX, managed languages C# and VB.NET, and JavaScript. Despite supporting the aforementioned managed languages, this developer platform is a COM-based API, and so it will produce native code.</p>

<p>The new applications run in full-screen, but two of them can be displayed side-by-side using ""Snap"". Examples of new applications that were demoed include a Twitter client, a weather application, a stock-tracking application, an RSS news feeder, and a virtual piano.</p>

<p>The new interface is primarily designed for 16:9 screen resolutions, with 1366×768 and larger screens able to display two Windows 8 applications. 1024×768 screens can display one Windows 8 application in full-screen, and 1024×600 screens can only use the traditional Windows desktop.</p>

<p>Windows 8 also adds support for ARM processors, in addition to continuing support for traditional x86 processors. </p>

<p>Significant client side technologies from Windows 8 have been incorporated into Windows Phone 8, helping to ease porting applications between these two distinct platforms.</p>

<p>Mike Angiulo confirmed at Computex 2011 that Windows 8 will use OEM Activation 3.0 instead of Windows 7 OEM Activation 2.1, which will make it less prone to cracks.</p>

netmask,A network mask is used to determine which part of an IP address belongs to the network and which part identifies the host.,"<p>A classic IP v4 address consists of a 32 bit binary number. 
This number is a concatenation of the network and the host number.</p>

<p>e.g. if I have network 1.2.3.0/8 with on that computer number 4 then we say that:  </p>

<ul>
<li>1.2.3.0 is the network</li>
<li>and 1.2.3.4 is the IP of a host on that network.</li>
</ul>

<p>To determine where the numbers for the network range stop and where the host part starts we need an extra item. This is the network mask.</p>

<p>Example using the number from above:</p>

<pre>
32 bits as a ruler  12345678 90123456 78901234 56789012
1.2.3.4 in binary   00000001 00000010 00000011 00000100

Network/Host        NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN NNNNNNNN HHHHHHHH
</pre>

<p>Here we see that 24 bits are used for the network part and 8 bits are used for the host.  If we turn all these N's into 1's and the H's into zeros then we can logically and and IP address with that mask and the result is the network.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
1.2.3.4 in binary   00000001 00000010 00000011 00000100
Mask                11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000
                    -----------------------------------  AND
                    00000001 00000010 00000011 00000<b>0</b>00
</pre>

<p>Thus the network is 00000001000000100000001100000000.</p>

<p>This is usually written in dotted decimal format where eight bits are grouped into one number. Simple binary calculation will show use that 00000001 equals 1, 00000010 equals 2, 00000011 equals 3 and 00000000 equals 0. Thus the network in dotted decimal notation is 1.2.3.0.</p>

<p>This is usually written as 1.2.3.0/8, or in the combination of ""network 1.2.3.0"" ""netmask 255.255.255.0"" where 255 is the binary values of the mask we ANDed with.</p>

<p>Specified in SD Version 3.01, support a clock frequency of 100 MHz (a quadrupling of the original ""Default Speed""), which in four-bit transfer mode could transfer 50 MB/s. UHS-I cards declared as UHS104 also support a clock frequency of 208 MHz, which could transfer 104 MB/s. Double data rate operation at 50 MHz (DDR50) is also specified in Version 3.01, and is mandatory for microSDHC and microSDXC cards labeled as UHS-I. In this mode, four bits are transferred when the clock signal rises and another four bits when it falls, transferring an entire byte on each full clock cycle.</p>

<p><strong>UHS-II</strong></p>

<p>Specified in SD Version 4.0, further raise the data transfer rate to a theoretical maximum of 312 MB/s.</p>

<p>Cards that comply with UHS show UHS-I or UHS-II on the label, and report this capability to the host device. Use of UHS requires that the host device command the card to drop from 3.3-volt to 1.8-volt operation and select the 4-bit transfer mode.</p>

Lync is built to fully integrate with Microsoft Office.","<p>Questions with this tag should refer specifically to versions of Microsoft Lync 2013.

</ul>

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>Organizations can purchase Lync Online as a standalone service from Microsoft Office 365 or as part of an Office 365 for enterprises suite that includes Lync Online, Microsoft Exchange Online, Microsoft SharePoint Online, Microsoft Office Professional Plus, and Microsoft Office Web Apps. 
Organizations that subscribe to Lync Online retain control over the collaboration services they offer to users, but they do not have the operational burden of on-premises server software. With the Lync Online multi-tenant hosted plans, Lync is hosted on multi-tenant servers that support multiple customers simultaneously. These servers are housed in Microsoft data centers and are accessible to users on a wide range of devices from inside a corporate network or over the Internet.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>Basic features include instant messaging, Voice Over IP, and video conferencing inside the client software. Advanced features are related to integration with other Microsoft software:</p>

<ul>
<li>Availability of contacts is based on Microsoft Outlook contacts
stored in a Microsoft Exchange Server</li>
<li>Contact lists can be retrieved    from a local directory service,
like Microsoft Exchange Server</li>
<li>Microsoft Office can show if other people are working on the same
document</li>
<li>All communication between the clients is done through a Microsoft
Lync Server server. This makes communications more secure, as
messages do not need to leave the corporate intranet, unlike with the
Internet based Windows Live Messenger. The server can be set to relay
messages to other instant messaging networks, avoiding installation
of extra software at the client side.</li>
<li>A number of client types are available for Microsoft Lync, including
mobile clients.</li>
<li>Uses SIP as the basis for its client communication protocol</li>
<li>Offers support for TLS and SRTP to encrypt and secure signaling and
media traffic.</li>
<li>Allows sharing files.</li>
</ul>

<p>The main new features of this version are the addition of real-time multi-client collaborative software capabilities, (which allow teams of people to see and simultaneously work on the same documents and communications session). These features are implemented as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Collaboration through Whiteboard documents, where the participants
have great freedom to share text, drawing and graphical annotations.</li>
<li>Collaboration through Power Point documents, where the participants
can control and see presentations, as well as allow everybody to add
text, drawing and graphical annotations.</li>
<li>Polling lists, where Presenters can organize polls and all
participants can vote and see results.</li>
<li>Desktop sharing, usually by allowing participants to see and
collaborate on your windows screen.</li>
<li>Windows applications sharing, by allowing participants to see and
collaborate on a specific application.</li>
</ul>

<p>All collaboration sessions get automatically defined as conferences, where clients can invite more contacts. Conference initiators (usually called organizers) can either promote participants to act as presenters or demote them to act as attendees. They can also define some basic policies about what presenters and attendees are able to see and do. Deeper details of policy permissions are defined at server level.</p>

<p>Most notably, in general computer usage, it refers to placing a password-based or biometric protection over a device, a system or a set of data. Examples include the operating system's lock screen, and password protection on files and folders.</p>

<p>It could also refer to freezing certain configuration or data (like files) so that it is protected from misconfiguration or unintended change by the user who locked it or by others. Examples include the administrative locks placed on system configuration modules, and the act of making files read-only for the users or inaccessible for other applications by the application opening them (known as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_locking"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>file locking</em></a>).</p>

<p>Questions using this tag can also be regarding the opposite action of unlocking. These questions could be about problems that appear during the attempt to reverse the effects of a lock, or that persists after the unlock has been performed.</p>

<p>In computer programming, locking refers to a method of synchronization between two contenting applications or threads sharing the same data. Questions regarding this are best asked in Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>In the early days of MySQL, InnoDB was made available to MySQL as an additional transactional storage along with BDB. <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/Acquisitions/innobase/index.html?origref=http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=AgwSuslm7SmUxujpui2AvKGbvZx4?fr=yfp-t-892-s&amp;toggle=1&amp;cop=mss&amp;ei=UTF8&amp;p=innobase%20oracle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The company that developed InnoDB, InnoBase Oy, was purchased by Oracle in October 2005</a>. <a href=""http://www.percona.com/about-us/our-mission/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Percona</a> has contributed great improvements to <a href=""http://www.percona.com/software/percona-xtradb/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">its own Open Source version of InnoDB (XtraDB).</a> Oracle, who eventually became the owner of MySQL via purchasing Sun, has incorporated most of those changes into InnoDB, as well adding improvements of their own. As a result, InnoDB has transformed into a more mature storage engine that handles mulitprocessing and multithreading more robustly. <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-default-se.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">As of December 2010, InnoDB has become the default storage engine for MySQL 5.5</a>. </p>

<p>MySQL 5.5 also has enhancements to facilitate InnoDB in engaging multiple CPUs. Those enhancements were introduced in MySQL 5.1.38 in the InnoDB Plugin only. Those enhancements have now been included with MySQL 5.5.</p>

<p>MySQL 5.5 also comes with new features such as <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/replication-semisync.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Semisynchronous Replication</a>, Multiple InnoDB Buffers Pools, plugins for user-defined authentication, performance metrics instrumentation, and more !!!</p>

<p>In a <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/439460"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">recent Oracle press release</a>, one of the new features for MySQL 5.6 is to have InnoDB with FULLTEXT searching. This will be a major step forward for this storage engine as this was one of the most requested and sought after features.</p>

<p>The basic infrastructure of InnoDB centers around three major files</p>

<ul>
<li>ibdata1, or System Tablespace (See <code>InnoDB Architecture</code>)</li>
<li>ib_logfile0 (See <code>InnoDB Architecture</code>)</li>
<li>ib_logfile1 (See <code>InnoDB Architecture</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>In conjunction with memory structures, ibdata1 processes info for 6 basic data structures</p>

<ul>
<li>Table Data Pages</li>
<li>Table Index Pages</li>
<li>Table MetaData (List of Tablespace IDs + Misc Info)</li>
<li>MVCC Records

<ul>
<li>Rollback Segments</li>
<li>Undo Space</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Double Write Buffer (Allows Background Page Writes)</li>
<li>Insert Buffer (For Collecting/Processing Changes to Secondary Indexes)</li>
</ul>

<h1>InnoDB Architecture</h1>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjRaE.jpg"" alt=""InnoDB Architecture""></p>

<p>InnoDB Configurations can accommodate the following</p>

<ul>
<li>Separating Table Data and Index Pages from the System Tablespace</li>
<li>Storing the System Tablespace in a Raw Disk Partition</li>
<li>Creating Multiple System Tablespace Files</li>
<li>Creating Multiple Log Files</li>
<li>and more...</li>
</ul>

<p>There is important cache known as the InnoDB Buffer Pool. As of MySQL 5.5, you can configure multiple buffer pool instances. Prior to MySQL 5.5, there is only one buffer pool instance.</p>

You can use them to see network requests that your browser makes as well as any JavaScript and CSS warnings and errors that it encounters when loading a page. You can use them to debug performance problems with your site.</p>

<p>You can use the developer tools to debug code running Firefox for Android, and soon, Firefox OS. We've also provided tools that target mobile development: the Responsive Design View is a quick way to see how a site will look on a small screen, and the Firefox OS Simulator lets you run and debug a Firefox OS app on the desktop without needing to use a real Firefox OS device.</p>

<p>Firefox add-ons can access the debugger API, so you can build your own developer tools that extend and enhance the built-in tools. With the remote debugging protocol you can implement your own debugging clients and servers, enabling you to debug websites using your own tools or to debug different targets using the Firefox tools.</p>

ssis,Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) is a platform for building enterprise-level data integration and data transformations solutions. ,"<p>You use Integration Services to solve complex business problems by copying or downloading files, sending e-mail messages in response to events, updating data warehouses, cleaning and mining data, and managing SQL Server objects and data. The packages can work alone or in concert with other packages to address complex business needs. Integration Services can extract and transform data from a wide variety of sources such as XML data files, flat files, and relational data sources, and then load the data into one or more destinations.</p>

<p>These types of operations are commonly referred to in the industry as <strong>ETL</strong>, which stands for:<br>
<strong>E</strong>&#8203;xtract, <strong>T</strong>&#8203;ransform and <strong>L</strong>&#8203;oad.</p>

<p>Integration Services includes a rich set of built-in tasks and transformations; tools for constructing packages; and the Integration Services service for running and managing packages. You can use the graphical Integration Services tools to create solutions without writing a single line of code; or you can program the extensive Integration Services object model to create packages programmatically and code custom tasks and other package objects.</p>

<p>The precursor to SSIS was released with SQL Server 2000, and was called Data Transformation Services (DTS).  SSIS was introduced with SQL Server 2005, and was a complete overhaul of the component, centering around control-flow-centric DTSX packages.  There were minor improvements with SQL Server 2008; the current version (released with SQL Server 2012) contains many differences from the 2008 one, including changes to deployment, debugging, troubleshooting and other areas. It has also had a visual face lift, with more attention to ease of development.</p>

This data may include SSL private keys, passwords, and web pages that were recently served or visited, thereby defeating the security provided by SSL. The vulnerability affected a large portion of websites which provide HTTPS support, including Yahoo! and Imgur.</p>

<p>Not only webservers are vulnerable, other services using OpenSSL for transport security are affected, for example mail servers (SMTP, IMAP, POP3) and VPN servers (OpenVPN) are also affected.</p>

<p>The vulnerability was patched in an update released on April 7, 2014 according to the <a href=""https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenSSL Security advisory</a>.

This locking avoids unexpected changes to the file while the program has it open and is using it to prevent corruption or other undesirable behavior (like the program crashing).</p>

<p>When a file or folder is locked, it cannot be moved, renamed, or deleted. This is usually resolved by closing the program that has it open, but sometimes the lock remains even after the program is closed and utilities have to be used to forcibly close the lock. Forcibly closing the lock while the program is still running may cause the program to crash if it then tries to access it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CAN bus is a message-based protocol, designed specifically for automotive applications but now also used in other areas such as aerospace, maritime, industrial automation and medical equipment.</p>
  
  <p>Development of the CAN bus started originally in 1983 at Robert Bosch GmbH. The protocol was officially released in 1986 at the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) congress in Detroit, Michigan. The first CAN controller chips, produced by Intel and Philips, came on the market in 1987. Bosch published the CAN 2.0 specification in 1991. In 2012 Bosch has specified the improved CAN data link layer protocol, called CAN FD, which will extend the ISO 11898-1.</p>
  
  <p>CAN bus is one of five protocols used in the on-board diagnostics (OBD)-II vehicle diagnostics standard. The OBD-II standard has been mandatory for all cars and light trucks sold in the United States since 1996, and the EOBD standard has been mandatory for all petrol vehicles sold in the European Union since 2001 and all diesel vehicles since 2004.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>YAML (/ˈjæməl/, rhymes with camel) is a human-readable data
  serialization language that takes concepts from programming languages
  such as C, Perl, and Python, and ideas from XML and the data format of
  electronic mail (RFC 2822). YAML was first proposed by Clark Evans in
  2001, who designed it together with Ingy döt Net and Oren Ben-Kiki. It
  is available for several programming languages.</p>
  
  <p>YAML is a recursive acronym for ""YAML Ain't Markup Language"". Early in
  its development, YAML was said to mean ""Yet Another Markup Language"",
  but it was then reinterpreted (backronyming the original acronym) to
  distinguish its purpose as data-oriented, rather than document markup.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Features</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Its familiar indented outline and lean appearance make it especially suited for tasks where humans are likely to view or edit data structures, such as configuration files, dumping during debugging, and document headers.</li>
<li>Although well-suited for hierarchical data representation, it also has a compact syntax for relational data as well.</li>
<li>A major part of its accessibility comes from eschewing the use of enclosures like quotation marks, brackets, braces, and open/close-tags, which can be hard for the human eye to balance in nested hierarchies.</li>

lxc,"LXC short for (Linux Containers) LXC is an operating system-level virtualization method for running multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) on a single control host.
LXC is the userspace control package for Linux Containers, a lightweight virtual system mechanism sometimes described as “chroot on steroids”.","<p>LXC provides <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system-level_virtualization"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">operating system-level virtualization</a> not via a full blown virtual machine, but rather provides a virtual environment that has its own process and network space. LXC relies on the Linux kernel cgroups functionality that became available in version 2.6.29 and is now available in all newer kernel versions.
<a href=""http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cgroups</a> was developed as part of LXC. It also relies on other kinds of namespace-isolation functionality, which were developed and integrated into the mainline Linux kernel. LXC is similar to other OS-level virtualization technologies on Linux such as <a href=""http://wiki.openvz.org/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenVZ</a> and <a href=""http://linux-vserver.org/Welcome_to_Linux-VServer.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Linux-VServer</a>, as well as those on other operating systems such as <a href=""http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/jails.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FreeBSD jails</a>. LXC Containers can define various <a href=""https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Resource_Management_Guide/ch-Subsystems_and_Tunable_Parameters.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cpu limits, memory limits etc.</a> (In short all parameters that can be set via <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cgroups/cgroups.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CGROUPS</a>)  to prevent any one container from interfering with all other containers running on the same LXC host. LXC uses the linux bridge-utils commands to create local VLANs, and attach containers and physical interfaces to them. With containers the physical overhead (ram, swap space, one kernel per VM, plus hypervisor) that is present in virtualization methods is reduced. With containers, one kernel and one virtual memory space is shared between all the containers running on that host.

<p>Nodes (hosts and routers) use Neighbor Discovery to determine the link-layer addresses for neighbors known to reside on attached links and to quickly purge cached values that become invalid.  </p>

<p>Hosts also use Neighbor Discovery to find neighboring routers that are willing to forward packets on their behalf.  </p>

<p>Finally, nodes use the protocol to actively keep track of which neighbors are reachable and which are not, and to detect changed link-layer addresses.  When a router or the path to a router fails, a host actively searches for functioning alternates.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>perf</code> began as a tool for using the performance counters subsystem in Linux, and has had various enhancements to add tracing capabilities.</p>
  
  <p>Performance counters are CPU hardware registers that count hardware events such as instructions executed, cache-misses suffered, or branches mispredicted. They form a basis for profiling applications to trace dynamic control flow and identify hotspots. <code>perf</code> provides rich generalized abstractions over hardware specific capabilities. Among others, it provides per task, per CPU and per-workload counters, sampling on top of these and source code event annotation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Perf is natively supported in popular Linux distributions, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Debian (<code>linux-tools</code> package).</p>

<hr>

<p><code>perf</code> is used with several subcommands (short, non-exhaustive list):</p>

<ul>
<li><code>stat</code>: runs a command and gather performance counter statistics;</li>
<li><code>top</code>: displays top-like dynamic view of hottest functions;</li>
<li><code>record</code>: runs a command and records its profile into <code>perf.data</code>;</li>
<li><code>report</code>: analyzes file generated by <code>perf record</code>; can generate flat, or graph profile;</li>
<li><code>annotate</code>: reads <code>perf.data</code> (created by <code>perf record</code>) and displays annotated code.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's business model is based on a paid subscription to underwrite support and upgrades.  With an intended usage requiring extreme stability and reliability, major releases can be two to four years apart, with a release life cycle spanning 7-10 years or more.  Minor releases, termed updates, are generally more often than once per year.</p>

<h3>Related distributions</h3>

<p>The Red Hat family of Linux distributions use the RPM Package Manager (a recursive acronym, originally the Red Hat Package Manager).</p>

<p><strong>Fedora</strong> is a community-based, open source distribution sponsored by Red Hat.  It serves as a test bed for new features, with a major release twice per year.  Recent major releases of RHEL have been forked from the Fedora release of a year prior and may incorporate some features from more recent Fedora releases. </p>

<p><strong>CentOS</strong> is a community based, open source distribution that is  functionally compatible with RHEL.  It is based on RHEL source code, with the RHEL branding removed.  It is released within a few months of the corresponding RHEL release.</p>

<p>Fedora and CentOS have product-specific tags.  Do not use Red Hat tags generically for questions about those products.</p>

<h3>Independent distributions</h3>

<p>A number of third parties produce Linux distributions based on RHEL source code:</p>

<p><strong>Scientific Linux</strong> is sponsored by Fermilab.  It starts with de-branded RHEL source code similar to CentOS.  While CentOS aims to be 100% binary compatible with RHEL, Scientific Linux adds packages and tweaks.</p>

<p><strong>Oracle Linux</strong> is also a repackaging of RHEL source code by the Oracle Corporation.  It offers the option of an Oracle-enhanced kernel. </p>

<p>Both Scientific Linux and Oracle Linux have dedicated tags.  Use those for issues unique to those distributions.  For most questions that are common to the Red Hat source, however, you will attract a larger audience of potential answerers by using a corresponding Red Hat or CentOS tag, and then mention the actual distribution in the question.</p>

<h3>Tag usage</h3>

<p>For issues specific to a particular RHEL version, there are version-specific tags:</p>

<ul>

snap-package,"For questions about Linux Snap application packages.  Do not use for questions concerning other ""snap"" terms, such as Snapchat and other applications named ""Snap"", screenshot or image software, ""snap-to"" action related to object placement, etc.","<p>Snaps are self-contained software application packages that work across a range of Linux distributions.  Unlike traditional Linux package management approaches, like APT or YUM, the ""Snappy"" software deployment and package management system does not require specifically adapted packages for each Linux distribution.</p>

<p>Snaps themselves have no dependency on any repository or ""app store"", so they can be obtained from any source and can be used for upstream software deployment. </p>

<p>Snappy was originally designed and developed by Canonical for the Ubuntu phone operating system.  The tool for using Snap packages, snapd, has been ported to a wide range of Linux distributions to enable snaps to be used across any Linux distribution, not just the all-snap Ubuntu Core. snapd is available or in progress for Arch Linux, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo Linux, Solus, Manjaro Linux, Linux Mint, OpenEmbedded, Raspbian, OpenWrt and openSUSE.</p>

<p>Each distribution is able to interpret the snap metadata to implement security or other expectations of the snap in a distribution-specific fashion.  However, the non-distro-specific nature of snaps also means that these packages are not integrated with a distro in the way packages from the distro's repository might be.  So installation of a snap may require tweaking to integrate it with other functionality of the distro.</p>
